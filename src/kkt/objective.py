"""Objective variable detection for KKT system assembly.

In GAMS NLP models, the objective function is typically represented as:
1. An objective variable (e.g., "obj", "z", "cost")
2. A defining equation that sets the objective variable equal to the
   objective expression (e.g., "objdef.. obj =E= sum(i, c(i)*x(i));")

For KKT transformation, we need to:
- Identify the objective variable and its defining equation
- Include the defining equation in the MCP model
- Decide whether to create a stationarity equation for the objective variable
  (typically no, since it's defined by the equation, not optimized over)
