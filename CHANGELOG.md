## [Unreleased]

### Sprint 2: Differentiation Engine (AD) + Jacobians

#### Day 1 (2025-10-28) - AD Foundation & Design

##### Added
- Created `src/ad/` module for automatic differentiation
- Implemented symbolic differentiation framework in `src/ad/ad_core.py`
- Added derivative rules for constants and variable references in `src/ad/derivative_rules.py`
- Created initial test suite in `tests/ad/test_ad_core.py`
- Added architecture documentation in `docs/ad_architecture.md`

##### Changed
- N/A

##### Fixed
- N/A

#### Day 2 (2025-10-28) - Arithmetic Operations & AST Evaluator

##### Added
- Implemented symbolic differentiation for Binary operations (+, -, *, /) in `src/ad/derivative_rules.py`
  - Addition and subtraction using sum/difference rules
  - Multiplication using product rule: d(a*b)/dx = b*(da/dx) + a*(db/dx)
  - Division using quotient rule: d(a/b)/dx = (b*(da/dx) - a*(db/dx))/bÂ²
- Implemented symbolic differentiation for Unary operators (+, -)
- Created AST evaluator in `src/ad/evaluator.py`
  - Evaluate expressions with concrete variable/parameter values
  - Support for all v1 expression types (constants, variables, binary, unary, functions)
  - Handle indexed variables and parameters
- Implemented comprehensive NaN/Inf detection
  - Check for NaN in all arithmetic operations
  - Check for Inf in all operations
  - Domain violation checks (division by zero, log of negative, sqrt of negative)
  - Clear, actionable error messages with context
- Created `tests/ad/test_arithmetic.py` with 15 tests for differentiation
- Created `tests/ad/test_evaluator.py` with 19 tests for evaluation and safety
- Exported `evaluate` and `EvaluationError` from `src/ad/__init__.py`

##### Changed
- Updated `src/ad/derivative_rules.py` to include Binary and Unary in dispatcher

##### Fixed
- N/A
