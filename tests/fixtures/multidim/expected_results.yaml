# Template for multi-dimensional indexing fixture expected results
#
# Each fixture should have an entry with:
# - input: Path to .gms file
# - expected: Expected parsing behavior
#
# Example:
# - fixture_name: 2d_indexing
#   input: 2d_indexing.gms
#   expected:
#     parse_success: true
#     variable_name: x
#     dimensions: 2
#     index_sets: ["i", "j"]
#     indexing_pattern: "x(i,j)"
#
# Fixtures to be added in Day 8
