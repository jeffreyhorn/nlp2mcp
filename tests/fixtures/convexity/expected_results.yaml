# Expected Results for Convexity Pattern Detection POC
#
# This file specifies the expected number of warnings each test model
# should generate when analyzed by scripts/poc_convexity_patterns.py
#
# Format:
#   filename: expected_warning_count
#
# Warning Types:
#   - nonlinear_equality: Nonlinear equality constraints
#   - trig_function: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
#   - bilinear_term: Products of variables (x*y)
#   - variable_quotient: Variable in denominator (x/y)
#   - odd_power: Odd powers of variables (x^3, x^5)

# Convex Models (should pass with 0 warnings)
convex_lp.gms: 0                        # Linear program - all constraints linear
convex_qp.gms: 0                        # Convex QP - quadratic objective, linear constraints
convex_with_nonlinear_ineq.gms: 0       # Convex inequalities are allowed

# Non-Convex Models (should generate warnings)
nonconvex_circle.gms: 1                 # 1 warning: nonlinear equality (circle)
nonconvex_trig.gms: 2                   # 2 warnings: trig function + nonlinear equality
nonconvex_bilinear.gms: 1               # 1 warning: bilinear term (x*y)
nonconvex_quotient.gms: 1               # 1 warning: variable quotient (x/y)
nonconvex_odd_power.gms: 1              # 1 warning: odd powers (x^3, y^3)
