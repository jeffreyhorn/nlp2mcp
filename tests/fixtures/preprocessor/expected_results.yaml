#
# Each fixture should have an entry with:
# - input: Path to .gms file
# - expected: Expected parsing behavior
#
# Example:
# - fixture_name: conditional_set
#   input: conditional_set.gms
#   expected:
#     parse_success: true
#     sets_extracted:
#       - name: i
#         default_value: "1*10"
#     macros_expanded:
#       - macro: "%myvar%"
#         expanded_to: "default_value"
