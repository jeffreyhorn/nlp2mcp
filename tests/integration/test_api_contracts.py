"""
API Contract Tests

These tests validate that API boundaries between modules remain stable.
They catch breaking changes like Issue #22 (gradient.mapping.num_vars → gradient.num_cols)
and Issue #24 (bounds storage location).

Contract tests are integration tests that:
- Verify public API attributes exist
- Check API consistency (e.g., num_cols == len(instances))
- Prevent regression of known issues
- Fail fast when APIs change

Run these tests first in CI to catch API violations immediately.
