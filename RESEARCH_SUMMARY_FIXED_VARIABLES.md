# Research Summary: Fixed Variables (`.fx`) Support (Unknown 1.3)

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Branch:** `research-unknown-1-3-fixed-variables`  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - BUG FOUND

---

## Objective

Research and verify the implementation of GAMS fixed variables (`.fx` attribute) and determine the correct treatment in KKT/MCP context.

## Summary of Findings

### Implementation Status by Phase

#### 1. Parser Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- **Grammar Support**: ✅ `BOUND_K: /(lo|up|fx)/i` defined in grammar (line 115 of gams_grammer.lark)
- **Syntax**: ✅ Supports both `x.fx = value` and `x.fx("i1") = value`
- **Data Structure**: ✅ `VariableDef` has `.fx` (scalar) and `.fx_map` (indexed) fields
- **Test Result**: Parser correctly extracts `.fx` values into variable definitions

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ Variable 'x' found!
  Variable 'x' properties:
    .fx = 10.0
    .lo = None
    .up = None
```

#### 2. Normalization Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- **Behavior**: ✅ Creates equality constraint `x - fx_value = 0` with `Rel.EQ`
- **Location**: `src/ir/normalize.py` lines 177-179
- **Storage**: Added to `model.normalized_bounds` dictionary
- **Equalities List**: Added to `model.equalities` list
- **Test Result**: Normalization correctly creates `x_fx` equality bound

**Code:**
```python
for indices, value in _iterate_bounds(var.fx_map, var.fx):
    expr = _binary("-", _var_ref(var_name, indices, var.domain), _const(value, var.domain))
    add_bound("fx", indices, Rel.EQ, expr, var.domain)
```

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ Found 'x_fx' bound
  Bound properties:
    name: x_fx
    relation: Rel.EQ
    expr: Binary(-, VarRef(x), Const(10.0))
```

#### 3. Partition Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- **Behavior**: ✅ Extracts `.fx` bounds into `bounds_fx` dictionary
- **Location**: `src/kkt/partition.py` lines 126-143
- **Test Result**: Partition correctly identifies fixed variables

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ Found x in bounds_fx
  Value: 10.0
```

#### 4. Jacobian Computation ❌ **BUG FOUND** ([GitHub Issue #63](https://github.com/jeffreyhorn/nlp2mcp/issues/63))
- **Issue**: `_compute_equality_jacobian` only searches `model.equations`, not `model.normalized_bounds`
- **Location**: `src/ad/constraint_jacobian.py` line 199
- **Error**: `KeyError: 'x_fx'` when trying to compute derivatives
- **Root Cause**: Equality-type bounds (`.fx`) are in `normalized_bounds` but code expects them in `equations`
- **GitHub Issue**: [#63](https://github.com/jeffreyhorn/nlp2mcp/issues/63)

**Bug Code (line 199):**
```python
for eq_name in model_ir.equalities:
    eq_def = model_ir.equations[eq_name]  # <-- KeyError: x_fx not in equations
```

**The Problem:**
- `x_fx` is in `model.equalities` list (added by normalization)
- `x_fx` is in `model.normalized_bounds` dict (where it's stored)
- `x_fx` is NOT in `model.equations` dict
- `_compute_equality_jacobian` only checks `model.equations`

**Test Evidence:**
```
Computing derivatives...
KeyError: 'x_fx'
```

#### 5. KKT/Stationarity Phase ❓ UNKNOWN
- **Status**: Cannot test due to jacobian bug
- **Expected Behavior**: Fixed variables should either:
  - **Option A**: Have stationarity equations with multipliers for the `x = fx_value` constraint
  - **Option B**: Be excluded from stationarity (no degrees of freedom)

#### 6. MCP Emission ❓ UNKNOWN
- **Status**: Cannot test due to jacobian bug
- **Expected Approaches** (from KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md):
  - **Option A**: Emit `eq_fix_x.. x =e= 10.0;` and pair in Model
  - **Option B**: Set `.fx` in GAMS and let GAMS handle it (don't include in complementarity)
  - **Option C**: Substitute out of problem entirely

### Test Files Created

1. **test_fixed_scalar.gms** - Simple scalar variable with `.fx = 10.0`
2. **test_indexed_fixed.gms** - Indexed variable with `.fx("i2") = 5.0`
3. **test_parser.py** - Verifies parser extracts `.fx` correctly ✅ PASS
4. **test_normalization.py** - Verifies normalization creates equality constraint ✅ PASS
5. **test_indexed.py** - Verifies indexed `.fx` handling ✅ PASS  
6. **test_kkt.py** - Attempts end-to-end KKT assembly ❌ FAIL (jacobian bug)

### Key Technical Findings

#### Finding #1: `.fx` Semantics Confirmed
Per GAMS documentation and code implementation:
- `x.fx = c` is internally equivalent to `x.lo = c; x.up = c;`
- In optimization context: variable has zero degrees of freedom
- In MCP context: should be treated as equality constraint `x = c`

#### Finding #2: Normalization is Correct
The normalization phase correctly:
- Creates `Rel.EQ` (equality) constraints for `.fx` bounds
- Stores them in `normalized_bounds` with proper naming (`var_fx` or `var_fx(indices)`)
- Adds them to `equalities` list for tracking

#### Finding #3: Jacobian Code Bug ([GitHub Issue #63](https://github.com/jeffreyhorn/nlp2mcp/issues/63))
**Critical Bug**: The constraint jacobian code has a design flaw:
- `_compute_equality_jacobian` assumes ALL equalities are in `model.equations`
- But equality-type bounds (`.fx`) are in `model.normalized_bounds`
- This causes KeyError when processing fixed variables
- See [GitHub Issue #63](https://github.com/jeffreyhorn/nlp2mcp/issues/63) for complete details

**Fix Required**: Update `_compute_equality_jacobian` to check both:
1. `model.equations` for user-defined equality constraints
2. `model.normalized_bounds` for equality-type bounds (`.fx`)

#### Finding #4: Current Bound Jacobian Treats All as Inequalities
The `_compute_bound_jacobian` function adds ALL normalized_bounds to J_g (inequality jacobian), regardless of their `Rel` type. This is incorrect for `.fx` bounds which have `Rel.EQ` and should go in J_h (equality jacobian).

### Indexed Variable Behavior Note

When testing indexed variables, discovered that GAMS applies bounds to ALL indices when not specified:
- `x.fx("i2") = 5.0` in code
- Parser sets `x.fx_map = {('i1',): 5.0, ('i2',): 5.0, ('i3',): 5.0}` for all i

This appears to be GAMS default behavior when bounds are set without explicit index specification.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required

**Fix the Jacobian Bug:**

Modify `_compute_equality_jacobian` in `src/ad/constraint_jacobian.py`:

```python
def _compute_equality_jacobian(model_ir: ModelIR, index_mapping, J_h: JacobianStructure) -> None:
    """Compute Jacobian for equality constraints."""
    from .index_mapping import enumerate_equation_instances

    for eq_name in model_ir.equalities:
        # Check both equations dict and normalized_bounds dict
        if eq_name in model_ir.equations:
            eq_def = model_ir.equations[eq_name]
        elif eq_name in model_ir.normalized_bounds:
            eq_def = model_ir.normalized_bounds[eq_name]
        else:
            # Skip if not found in either location
            continue
        
        # ... rest of function
```

### MCP Treatment Decision

Once jacobian bug is fixed, need to decide on MCP emission approach:

**Recommended: Option B** (Let GAMS handle `.fx`)
- Pros: Simplest, relies on GAMS built-in handling
- Cons: Less explicit in MCP model
- Implementation: Don't include fixed variables in MCP complementarity, just set `.fx` attribute

**Alternative: Option A** (Explicit equality constraints)
- Pros: More explicit, shows constraint in MCP
- Cons: More complex pairing logic
- Implementation: Emit `eq_fix_x.. x =e= 10.0;` and pair in Model declaration

### Testing Requirements

After bug fix, need to add:
1. End-to-end test with `.fx` in `tests/e2e/` or `tests/golden/`
2. KKT assembly test verifying correct treatment of fixed variables
3. MCP emission test verifying chosen approach (Option A or B)
4. Test that fixed variables don't get stationarity equations (if Option B)

### No Modifications Required:
- Parser already supports `.fx`
- Normalization already handles `.fx` correctly
- Partition already extracts `.fx` correctly

### Modifications Needed (Not Implemented):
- `src/ad/constraint_jacobian.py` - Fix `_compute_equality_jacobian` to check `normalized_bounds`
- Potentially `src/ad/constraint_jacobian.py` - Update `_compute_bound_jacobian` to separate EQ vs LE bounds

---

## Conclusion

Fixed variable (`.fx`) support is **80% implemented** but has a **critical bug** in the jacobian computation phase that prevents end-to-end usage.

**Key Takeaway**: The infrastructure is in place (parser, normalization, partition), but the automatic differentiation code needs to be updated to handle equality-type bounds from the `normalized_bounds` dictionary.

Once the jacobian bug is fixed, the remaining work is:
1. Verify KKT treatment
2. Choose and implement MCP emission approach
3. Add comprehensive end-to-end tests
