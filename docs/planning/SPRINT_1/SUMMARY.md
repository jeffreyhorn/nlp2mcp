# Sprint 1 Summary

Sprint 1 (MVP parser + model IR) is complete. The repository now contains the core parsing pipeline, normalization utilities, and regression tests outlined in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

## Delivered Artifacts
- `src/gams/gams_grammer.lark` – Earley grammar for the targeted GAMS NLP subset with ambiguity resolution helpers in the parser.
- `src/ir/ast.py`, `src/ir/model_ir.py`, `src/ir/symbols.py`, `src/ir/parser.py`, `src/ir/normalize.py` – Expression AST, symbol table types, Model IR container, semantic actions, and constraint/bound normalization logic.
- `tests/gams/test_parser.py` (19 tests) and `tests/ir/test_normalize.py` (10 tests) – Cover declaration parsing, IR population, error cases, and canonicalization rules.
- `examples/` (`simple_nlp.gms`, `scalar_nlp.gms`, `indexed_balance.gms`, `bounds_nlp.gms`, `nonlinear_mix.gms`) – Reference models used in tests and manual validation.

## Goals Accomplished
- Parse declarations (`Sets`, `Aliases`, `Parameters`, `Variables`, `Equations`) and the `Solve … using NLP` statement into a deterministic `ModelIR`, including objective metadata.
- Resolve symbol domains and aliases, enforce dimension checks, and surface semantic errors with line/column context via `ParserSemanticError`.
- Build a typed AST supporting arithmetic, logical comparisons, sums, and standard nonlinear functions required for later AD work.
- Normalize equations and collected variable bounds into `<= 0`/`= 0` form while tracking domain metadata, producing ready-to-use equality/inequality partitions.
- Maintain high-confidence coverage through automated tests that exercise both happy paths and guarded failure modes.

## Remaining Sprint 1 Work
- No outstanding Sprint 1 deliverables remain; all acceptance criteria in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` are satisfied. Preparatory work for Sprint 2 (automatic differentiation) can begin.
