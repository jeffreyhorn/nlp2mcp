**Ready to Start Sprint 4 When:**
- Known Unknowns List created
- PATH solver validation set up
- Checkpoint templates formalized
- Sprint 4 plan created

## Planning Process

### Planning Workflow
1. **Initial Plan** - First draft of sprint scope and schedule
2. **Review Round 1** - Identify risks and unknowns
3. **Revised Plan** - Address review feedback
4. **Review Round 2** - Deep dive on critical items
5. **Final Plan** - Ready for execution with risks mitigated

### Key Practices (Established in Sprint 3)
- ✅ **Two-round planning reviews** - Catch issues before coding
- ✅ **Known unknowns lists** - Document assumptions explicitly
- ✅ **Mid-sprint checkpoints** - Day 3, 6, 8 health checks
- ✅ **Complexity estimation** - Identify high-risk days
- ✅ **Golden reference files** - Protect against regressions
- ✅ **Integration health checks** - Verify Sprint 1/2/3 compatibility

## Lessons Learned (Sprint 2 & 3)

### What Worked Well ⭐
1. Two-round planning review process
2. Comprehensive test coverage (602 tests, 89% coverage)
3. Golden reference files for regression testing
4. Type safety with mypy (caught 3-4 bugs early)
5. Incremental development and daily testing
6. Clear separation of concerns (modular architecture)

### What Needs Improvement 📈
1. **Validation environment setup** - Should be Day 0, not Day 9
2. **Known unknowns documentation** - Proactive, not retrospective
3. **Early syntax validation** - Test with compiler immediately
4. **Formalized checkpoints** - Use templates, not ad-hoc
5. **Performance testing** - Establish baselines early

### Major Issues Encountered ⚠️
- **Sprint 2, Issue #22:** API mismatch (gradient.mapping.num_vars → gradient.num_cols)
- **Sprint 2, Issue #24:** Bounds storage confusion (normalized_bounds vs. equations)
- **Sprint 2, Issue #25:** Power operator (Binary("^") vs. Call("power"))
- **Sprint 3, Issue #47:** Indexed stationarity syntax (element-specific → indexed equations)

All issues caught by tests, but discovered late. Sprint 4 prep focuses on earlier detection.

## Archive Structure

Each sprint folder contains an `archive/` subdirectory with:
- Draft plans from planning iterations
- Working documents and intermediate reviews
- Historical context for decision-making

Archives are kept for reference but not prominent in navigation.

## Contributing to Planning

When creating new sprint plans:
1. Start with PROJECT_PLAN.md scope for that sprint
2. Create initial plan in SPRINT_X/PLAN.md
3. Conduct review rounds, store drafts in archive/ if needed
4. Create PREP_PLAN.md with pre-sprint tasks
5. Update this README.md with sprint status
