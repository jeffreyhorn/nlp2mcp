# Sprint 9 Plan Review

## Findings
- **Document length is below the required 1,500–2,000 lines.** Task 10 explicitly calls for a PLAN.md “target length: 1500‑2000 lines” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PREP_PLAN.md:2781`, `:2826`), but the current plan is only 1,236 lines (`wc -l docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md`). This is materially shorter than Sprint 8’s 1,715‑line document and does not meet the stated deliverable.
- **Effort allocation diverges from the mandated 30–41 hour budget.** The executive summary cites 34 h / 39 h / 44 h (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md:33-43`), the effort table later shows 36–48 h with a “realistic” 42 h (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md:715-727`), and Appendix A repeats 36–48 h (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md:1351-1365`). Task 10 requires validating a 30–41 hour budget (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PREP_PLAN.md:2701-2709`), so the current scope exceeds the target and is internally inconsistent.
- **Per-day effort estimates don’t match the enumerated tasks.** For example, Day 1 is budgeted at 4‑5 hours (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md:215-247`), yet the task list sums to roughly 5‑7 hours (2‑3h analysis + 0.5h documentation + 1‑2h implementation + 0.5h tests + 0.5h profiling). Day 6 is budgeted at 4‑6 hours (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md:372-447`), but the tasks aggregate to ~6‑8 hours (2‑3h semantic handler + 1h IR + 1h validation + 0.5‑1h debugging + 1‑1.5h tests + 0.5h dashboard). These mismatches undermine the effort table and make it difficult to trust the feasibility analysis.
- **Appendix B contradicts the main body on both duration and effort.** The comparison table states Sprint 9 effort is “36‑48h (average 42h)” and implies Sprint 8’s effort was 30‑41h (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN.md:1351-1365`), but the header retains “Duration: 11 days (Days 0‑10, Day 10 buffer)” and the executive summary positions the upper bound at 44h. These conflicting numbers create confusion about the actual scope and whether it satisfies the acceptance criteria.

## Recommendations
1. **Expand the document to meet the 1,500–2,000 line requirement.** Add the missing depth—e.g., more detailed task explanations, appendices, or cross-reference material—to reach the mandated length and align with Sprint 8’s precedent.
2. **Reconcile the effort budget with the 30–41 hour target.** Either descope work (e.g., defer optional dashboard/performance items) so the lower/upper totals fall within 30–41 hours, or explicitly adjust the target in PREP_PLAN/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS with justification. Ensure all sections (executive summary, Section 4, Appendix A) cite the same figures.
3. **Adjust day-level estimates to match the task lists.** For each day, ensure the listed tasks and their durations sum to the stated daily effort. If the true total is higher, update the daily effort table accordingly so downstream planning (critical path, buffer usage) is accurate.
4. **Update Appendix A (and other summaries) to match the corrected numbers.** Once the total effort/duration is consistent, rewrite the Sprint 8 vs Sprint 9 comparison so it no longer contradicts the main text and clearly communicates the increased complexity and hours. This will help reviewers assess feasibility and ordering/flow.
