# Sprint 9 Plan Re-review

## Findings
- **Effort table still sums outside the stated 30–41 hour budget.** Section 4 lists the “Realistic” column as 35.5 h (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN_REVISED.md:1050-1062`), but the individual entries—2.5 h (Day 0) + 7.5 h (Days 1‑2) + 9 h (Days 3‑4) + 13 h (Days 5‑6) + 7 h (Days 7‑8) + 2.5 h (Day 9) + 2 h (Day 10)—sum to **43.5 h**. The conservative column (2 + 6 + 8 + 11 + 6 + 2 + 1) totals 36 h, not 30 h. So, despite the narrative claiming 30‑41 h, the actual totals remain above the mandated range and internally inconsistent.
- **Day‑level effort statements conflict with the revised table.** The day breakdown headers still show “Day 9: … (4‑5 hours)” and “Day 10: … (2‑3 hours)” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_9/PLAN_REVISED.md:711` and `:750`), while the effort table claims 2‑3 h for Day 9 and 1‑2 h for Day 10. These mismatches make it unclear which numbers should drive scheduling and buffer calculations.

## Recommendations
1. **Recompute the conservative/realistic/upper totals so the column sums truly fall within 30–41 h, or explicitly adjust the target if more time is unavoidable.** Update every reference (executive summary, Section 4, Appendix A) to match the corrected totals.
2. **Align each day section header with the effort table.** If Day 9 is now 2‑3 h, change the heading and tasks accordingly (and likewise for Day 10), or update the effort table if the 4‑5 h/2‑3 h figures are still correct. This keeps the plan consistent and easier to execute.
