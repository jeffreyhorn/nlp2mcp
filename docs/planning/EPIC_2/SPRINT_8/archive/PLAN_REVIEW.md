# Sprint 8 Plan Review

## Findings
- **Total effort exceeds the 25–35h target and is internally inconsistent.** The effort section claims “Total Sprint 8 Effort: 30-36 hours” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:944-964`), but the own table sums to 32–41 hours (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:950-960`), and day-level estimates (2-3 + 6-8 + 4-5 + 6-8 + 4-5 + 4-5 + 3-4 + 4-6 + 3-4 + 4-5 + 2-3) total approximately 42–56 hours. This overshoots the specified 25–35 hour sprint scope from the task brief and contradicts the “27-36 hour” statement in the executive summary.
- **Day count/duration is inconsistent with the requirement.** The plan header states “Duration: 10 days (Days 0-9)” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:3`), yet it includes a Day 10 section (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:760-965`). The task requires a Day 0–10 breakdown (11 days). The mixed messaging makes it unclear whether Day 10 is in-scope or buffer, and whether the sprint is 10 or 11 days.
- **Early-day allocations are understated relative to the mandated total.** Several days are scoped at 2–5 hours (e.g., Day 0 at 2–3h `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:160-190`, Day 2 at 4–5h `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:267-307`, Day 4 at 4–5h `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:386-426`, Day 6 at 3–4h `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:503-546`). If the sprint is truly capped at 25–35h, these low allocations conflict with the much higher summed total; if the higher total is correct, the per-day hours don’t reconcile with a 10-day timeline.
- **Unknown verification deliverable not reflected.** The task calls for updating `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` to mark 8.1–8.3 as verified with findings. PLAN.md only references the unknowns abstractly (e.g., cross-reference table `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN.md:1426-1430`) and lacks a concrete step to perform or validate those updates during the sprint.

## Recommendations
1. **Recompute and align effort with the 25–35h requirement.** Decide the true total, update the feature and daily tables to match, and ensure the summed daily hours land within the target. If keeping the current scope, call out that it exceeds the 35h limit and adjust scope (e.g., reduce fixture count or lower-priority UX work) to fit.
2. **Clarify sprint length and day numbering.** Make the headline duration match the actual breakdown (either 0–9 for 10 days or 0–10 for 11 days). If Day 10 is a buffer, label it explicitly as such and adjust totals accordingly; otherwise include it in the day count in the header.
3. **Add explicit actions for Unknowns 8.1–8.3 verification.** Include a Day 0 (or Day 9/10) task to update `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` with verification results, per the task requirements, and cross-reference it in the checklist.
4. **Normalize day-level hours to match the chosen total.** If the sprint is constrained to 25–35h, rescope or merge lightweight days (2–5h blocks) to reduce calendar length or bring the average to a consistent daily allocation; if keeping 10–11 calendar days, ensure the per-day hours and total align and document any intended slack/buffer explicitly.***
