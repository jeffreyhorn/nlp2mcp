# Sprint 8 Plan Re-review

## Findings
- **Effort still exceeds the 25–35h target and the document remains internally inconsistent.** The feature table now shows 30–41h total with a “realistic” 35.5h (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN_REVISED.md:1004-1025`), and day-by-day ranges sum to roughly 47–61h (Day 0–9 lower bounds: ~47h, upper bounds: ~61h). This conflicts with the stated “11 days (Days 0-10, with Day 10 as BUFFER)” and the original 25–35h requirement. The executive summary claims a conservative 30h “within budget,” but the upper bound remains far above 35h, and average per active day is only ~3.5h, which is atypically low if the sprint truly spans 10–11 days.
- **Duration and day numbering are clearer but still misaligned with effort.** The header now says “11 days (Days 0-10, with Day 10 as BUFFER)” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN_REVISED.md:1-7`), and Day 10 is marked buffer, which fixes the prior ambiguity. However, with 10 active days and 30–41h of work, the per-day load averages 3–4h, implying significant slack or underestimation of necessary calendar time; if buffer is real, consider shortening the calendar or tightening scope to fit the 25–35h constraint.
- **Unknowns 8.1–8.3 verification acknowledged but not planned distinctively.** Day 0 now includes “Verify Known Unknowns (30 min)” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN_REVISED.md:163-189`), but the plan still lacks an explicit call-out to update `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` with the required verification entries; only a cross-reference remains (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN_REVISED.md:1426-1430`).
- **Appendix comparison contradicts the main body.** Appendix B still states Sprint 8 duration “10 days (0-9)” and total effort “30-36 hours” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/PLAN_REVISED.md:1351-1365`), conflicting with the corrected header (11 days) and effort table (30–41h).

## Recommendations
1. **Bring the plan into the 25–35h envelope or explicitly adjust the target.** Either descope to keep lower and upper totals within 25–35h (e.g., defer some fixtures or optional UX work) or clearly state a revised target and rationale; remove the “within budget” claim if upper bounds stay above 35h.
2. **Synchronize duration and per-day load.** If keeping 11 calendar days with Day 10 as buffer, normalize daily hours to a realistic average (or reduce the calendar length) so totals and schedule align; otherwise, document intended slack explicitly.
3. **Plan the Unknowns update explicitly.** Add a concrete task (Day 0 or Day 9/10) to write the verification results for 8.1–8.3 into `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_8/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md`, with a corresponding quality gate.
4. **Fix lingering contradictions in appendices.** Update Appendix B (duration, total effort) to match the corrected header and effort section so the plan is self-consistent end-to-end.***
