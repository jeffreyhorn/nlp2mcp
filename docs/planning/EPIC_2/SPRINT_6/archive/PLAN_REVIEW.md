# Sprint 6 Plan Review

## Findings
- **Missing task assignments.** The objective for Task 10 explicitly requires a day-by-day schedule "with task assignments, dependencies, and checkpoints" (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PREP_PLAN.md:1338`), but no owner or assignee is listed for any Day 1–10 activity (e.g., `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:48`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:124`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:200`). As written, it's unclear who is accountable for each deliverable.
- **Unknown research scheduled too late.** The latest instructions require any unresolved Known Unknowns to be tackled on days *before* their information is needed. Several examples violate this: Day 4 resolves Unknowns 4.1/4.2 on the same day their outputs power CLI integration and documentation work (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:161` and `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:168`); Day 5 treats Unknowns 3.3/3.5 contemporaneously with ingestion automation (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:209`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:215`); Day 6 does the same for Unknown 3.4 before dashboard construction (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:246`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:252`). These schedules risk blocking because research conclusions are not available ahead of execution.
- **Checkpoint requirements not met.** Step 3 mandates that each checkpoint list acceptance criteria, demo artifacts, and a go/no-go decision (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PREP_PLAN.md:1405`). While go/no-go decisions are present, Checkpoints 1, 2, and 5 omit demo artifacts both in the daily sections (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:76`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:116`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:411`) and in the checkpoint summary (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:470`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:486`, `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_6/PLAN.md:536`). Only Checkpoints 3 and 4 specify demo expectations, so the acceptance criterion "3 checkpoints defined with demo criteria" is not actually satisfied.

## Recommendations
1. **Add explicit owners per day/task.** Extend each day section with an "Owner" or assignee list so accountability is clear (e.g., "Owner: Convexity sub-team" for Day 3). This will bring `PLAN.md` in line with the Task 10 objective and aid load balancing.
2. **Pull unknown research forward.** Insert prerequisite research tasks on earlier days (or flag dedicated half-days) so Unknowns 3.3–3.6 and 4.1–4.4 are resolved at least one day before their dependent implementation work begins. If calendar pressure prevents this, explicitly document the risk and justify any exception.
3. **Document demo artifacts for every checkpoint.** For Checkpoints 1, 2, and 5, define the demo scenario (e.g., screencast of nested min/max proof-of-concept, PATH comparison report, QA dashboard walkthrough) alongside the acceptance criteria and go/no-go call. Update the checkpoint summary so at least three checkpoints clearly enumerate demo expectations, satisfying the acceptance criteria already checked off in `PREP_PLAN.md`.
