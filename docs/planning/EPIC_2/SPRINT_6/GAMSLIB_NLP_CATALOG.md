### Parser Feature Coverage Summary

**Core Features (MUST HAVE for 90%+ models):**
- ✅ Variables with bounds (.lo, .up, .l, .fx)
- ✅ Equations (=e=, =l=, =g=)
- ✅ Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, **)
- ✅ Power functions (sqr, power, **)
- ✅ Model /all/ syntax
- ✅ Solve statement (minimizing/maximizing, using nlp)
- ✅ Sets and aliases
- ✅ Parameters and scalars

**Important Features (60-80% of models):**
- ✅ Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- ✅ Exp and log functions
- ✅ Sqrt function
- ✅ Set indexing and summation
- ✅ Multi-dimensional indexing
- ⚠️ Table statements (20-30% of models)
- ⚠️ Display statements (can be ignored for MCP generation)

**Advanced Features (<20% of models):**
- ⚠️ Loop constructs
- ⚠️ Conditionals ($ operators)
- ⚠️ Model suffixes (.solveStat, .modelStat, .objval)
- ⚠️ Ordered set operations (ord, card)
- ⚠️ Lag/lead operators (++, --)
- ❌ $include directives
- ❌ Min/max functions (separate reformulation needed)

### Known Parser Gaps (Blockers)

Based on analysis, current parser likely **cannot handle**:

1. **Table statements** - Used in ~20% of models (e.g., least, like, haverly, pool)
   - Example: `Table data(i,j) ... ;`
   - Workaround: Manual data extraction or skip these models

2. **Loop constructs** - Used in ~10% of models (e.g., trigx)
   - Example: `loop(i, solve m using nlp; );`
   - Workaround: Single-solve only, skip multi-solve models

3. **Conditionals with $** - Used in ~15% of models
   - Example: `$if not set TOL $set TOL 1e-6`
   - Example: `equation$(condition).. ...`
   - Workaround: Skip or manually simplify

4. **Model suffixes** - Used in ~10% of models  
   - Example: `m.solveStat`, `m.modelStat`, `obj.slack`
   - Workaround: These are post-solve, not needed for MCP generation

5. **Ordered set operations** - Used in ~5% of models
   - Example: `ord(i)`, `card(s)`
   - Workaround: Manual expansion or skip

### Expected Parse Success Rate

**Optimistic (60-70%):**
- Models with only core features
- Simple indexing
- Standard functions
- No tables, loops, or conditionals

**Realistic (40-50%):**
- Account for table statements (~20% of models)
- Account for conditional syntax (~15%)
- Account for loop constructs (~10%)
- Account for ordered operators (~5%)

**Conservative (30-40%):**
- Account for multiple blockers in same model
- Account for unknown edge cases
- Buffer for unexpected syntax

**Sprint 6 Target: 40-60% parse success for selected Tier 1 models**

## Sprint 6 Model Selection

### Tier 1: Initial Target Set (10 models)

Priority models for Sprint 6 ingestion, selected for:
- Simple syntax (parseable with current capabilities)
- Small to medium size
- Good coverage of core NLP features
- Downloadable and accessible
- Mix of convex and non-convex problems

| # | Seq | Name | Type | Size | Convexity | Rationale |
|---|-----|------|------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 261 | trig | NLP | Small | Non-convex | **Baseline**: Simple trig, minimal deps, well-tested |
| 2 | 83 | rbrock | NLP | Small | Non-convex | **Classic**: Rosenbrock, unconstrained, famous test |
| 3 | 36 | himmel16 | NLP | Small | Non-convex | **Sets**: Indexed vars, tests multi-dim, has max |
| 4 | 264 | hs62 | NLP | Small | Unknown | **H-S collection**: Standard test problem |
| 5 | 84 | mhw4d | NLP | Small | Non-convex | **Test problem**: Simple nonlinear test |
| 6 | 267 | mhw4dx | NLP | Small | Non-convex | **Extension**: MHW4D variant |
| 7 | 201 | circle | NLP | Small | Convex | **Geometric**: Circle packing, likely convex |
| 8 | 263 | maxmin | DNLP | Small | Non-convex | **Min-max**: Tests our reformulation |
| 9 | 255 | mathopt1 | NLP | Small | Unknown | **Simple**: MathOptimizer baseline |
| 10 | 299 | mingamma | DNLP | Small | Unknown | **Special func**: Gamma function test |

**Expected Parse Success:** 6-8 out of 10 (60-80%)

**Known Issues:**
- himmel16: Has lag/lead operators (++), may need manual fix
- maxmin: May involve min/max reformulation
- Some models may have display/loop statements (ignorable for MCP generation)

### Tier 2: Next Priority (10 models for Sprint 7)

| # | Seq | Name | Type | Size | Notes |
|---|-----|------|------|------|-------|
| 11 | 388 | trigx | NLP | Medium | Loop construct, multiple solutions |
| 12 | 229 | polygon | NLP | Small | COPS 2.0 #1, geometric |
| 13 | 230 | elec | NLP | Small | COPS 2.0 #2, electrons on sphere |
| 14 | 231 | chain | NLP | Small | COPS 2.0 #3, hanging chain |
| 15 | 245 | minsurf | NLP | Medium | COPS 2.0 #17, minimal surface |
| 16 | 254 | pool | NLP | Medium | Pooling problem, may have tables |
| 17 | 214 | haverly | NLP | Medium | Classic pooling, may have tables |
| 18 | 295 | mhw4dxx | NLP | Small | Multiple solutions variant |
| 19 | 20 | process | NLP | Medium | Alkylation process |
| 20 | 21 | chem | NLP | Small | Chemical equilibrium |

**Expected Parse Success:** 4-6 out of 10 (40-60%)

### Tier 3: Future Target (10+ models for Sprint 8+)

Deferred due to:
- Large size (100+ vars)
- Table statements required
- MINLP (integer variables not supported)
- Very specialized domains
- Known parser gaps

Examples:
- COPS 2.0 problems #4-16 (medium size)
- CGE models (splcge, stdcge, lrgcge, etc.)
- Process synthesis problems (procsel, synheat, hda, etc.)
- Financial models with tables (meanvar, worst, immun)
- MINLP variants (waterx, alan, feedtray, etc.)
