## Notes

**How to Use This Document:**

1. **Update after each PR merge** - Add PR entry to appropriate Day section
2. **Update parse rate table** - Add row when parse rate changes
3. **Document decisions immediately** - Capture context while fresh
4. **Update metrics at end** - Complete metrics tables on Day 10
5. **See incremental_documentation_guide.md** for detailed templates and examples

**Time Commitment:** 5-10 minutes per PR (40-80 minutes total over 10 days)

**Enforcement:** PR checklist requires SPRINT_LOG.md update before merge
