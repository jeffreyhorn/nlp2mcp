# Sprint 7 Plan Review

## Findings
- **Scope alignment clarified for multi-dimensional indexing.** Step 2 of Task 10 mentions Days 2–3 for multi-dimensional indexing, but Unknown 1.6 in `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` was verified (via Task 4) to show that multi-dim constructs already work end-to-end (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md:587-640`). With that gap closed, it is acceptable that PLAN.md focuses week 1 on the remaining parser blockers (preprocessor + set ranges); no additional multi-dim deliverables are required.
- **Effort estimates violate the 6–8 hour/day requirement.** Task 10 requires each day’s effort estimate to land within 6–8 hours (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PREP_PLAN.md:2033-2035`), but the plan budgets as little as 1–2 hours on Day 0 (`PLAN.md:195-219`), 3.5–4.5 hours on Day 1 (`PLAN.md:227-247`), 3.5–5 hours on Day 2 (`PLAN.md:256-275`), 3–4.5 hours on Day 3 (`PLAN.md:285-307`), and only 2–5 hours on Day 4 (`PLAN.md:316-338`). Conversely, Day 7 is scoped for up to 9 hours (`PLAN.md:425-457`). The acceptance criterion at `PREP_PLAN.md:2095-2100` (“Effort estimates realistic (6-8h per day)”) is therefore not satisfied.
- **Checkpoint 2 criteria don’t match the mandated thresholds.** The prep plan hard-codes Checkpoint 2 as “Test suite <60s (fast), <120s (full)” (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PREP_PLAN.md:2010-2014`). Checkpoint 2 in PLAN.md targets <60 s for the *full* suite (or <72 s conservative) and makes the <30 s fast suite optional, without ever referencing the <120 s full-suite requirement (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PLAN.md:652-678`). The checkpoint therefore fails to align with the instructed acceptance criteria.
- **Day 6 workload is underestimated.** Day 6 requires enabling xdist, running a full baseline, executing 10 consecutive parallel suite runs, fixing isolation issues, and benchmarking four worker counts (`PLAN.md:386-414`). Even if each full suite run takes ~60–70 s after optimization, the prescribed 10-iteration stress test plus multiple benchmark passes will consume well over the 4–7 hours allotted, leaving no buffer for debugging flaky tests. This threatens feasibility for the rest of the sprint.

## Recommendations
1. **Normalize daily effort estimates to the mandated 6–8 hour range.** Expand undersized days (0–4) by adding missing work (e.g., fixtures, documentation) and trim oversized blocks (Day 7) by moving optional work or padding earlier days so every entry satisfies `PREP_PLAN.md:2033-2035`.
2. **Update Checkpoint 2 acceptance criteria to match the instructions.** Explicitly require `<60s fast suite` and `<120s full suite` outcomes and document how each metric is verified (fast-mode command, full-suite timing) so the checkpoint satisfies `PREP_PLAN.md:2010-2014`.
3. **Re-estimate the Day 6 testing workload.** Either expand Day 6 to a full 6–8 hour allocation or split the stress-test/benchmarking effort across Days 6–7 so the repeated parallel test runs and debugging time fit within a realistic budget and don’t jeopardize Checkpoint 2.
