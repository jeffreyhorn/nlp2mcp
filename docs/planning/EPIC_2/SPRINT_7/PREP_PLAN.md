# Sprint 7 Preparation Plan

**Purpose:** Complete critical preparation tasks before Sprint 7 (Epic 2 - Parser Enhancements & GAMSLib Expansion)  
**Timeline:** Complete before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Goal:** Address Sprint 6 parser limitations and prepare for 30%+ GAMSLib parse rate target

**Key Insight from Sprint 6:** Parser limitations were underestimated - 9/10 GAMSLib models failed on preprocessor directives. Systematic analysis of parser gaps and prioritization of high-impact features is critical for Sprint 7 success.

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 6 achieved 10% GAMSLib parse rate (1/10 models) but revealed significant parser gaps. Sprint 7 aims to triple this to 30%+ by addressing:
1. **Priority 1 (Parser Gaps):** Preprocessor directives (`$if`, `$set`, `$include`) causing 9/10 failures
2. **Priority 2 (Advanced Features):** Multi-dimensional set indexing, table declarations, set operations
3. **Priority 3 (Performance):** Test suite optimization (107s → <60s for fast tests)
4. **Priority 4 (Quality):** Convexity refinements, CI automation, dashboard improvements

This prep plan focuses on research, analysis, and design tasks that must be completed before Sprint 7 Day 1 to ensure smooth execution and avoid parser complexity underestimation.

## Task 1: Create Sprint 7 Known Unknowns List

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Deadline:** 1 week before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Sprint planning team  
**Dependencies:** None

### Objective

Create comprehensive `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` documenting all assumptions, uncertainties, and research questions that could impact Sprint 7 execution.

### Why This Matters

Sprint 6 demonstrated that parser complexity was underestimated (only 10% parse rate vs expected higher baseline). Sprint 7 tackles even more complex parser features (preprocessor directives, multi-dimensional indexing) with many untested assumptions.

**Critical assumptions to validate:**
- Preprocessor directive handling approach (full vs mock)
- Multi-dimensional indexing impact on IR and normalization
- Test parallelization doesn't introduce race conditions
- GAMSLib models use parseable subset after adding new features
- Convexity warning line number tracking feasible with current parser

### Background

Sprint 4, 5, and 6 Known Unknowns processes successfully prevented late-stage surprises:
- Sprint 4: 23 unknowns, zero blocking issues
- Sprint 5: 22 unknowns, all resolved on schedule
- Sprint 6: 22 unknowns, enabled realistic scope setting

Sprint 7 adds complexity with parser internals modifications, requiring even more thorough unknown identification.

### What Needs to Be Done

**Create document with sections:**

1. **Parser Enhancement Unknowns** (10-12 unknowns expected)
   - Preprocessor directive handling strategy
   - Grammar modification scope and testing
   - Multi-dimensional indexing IR representation
   - Table declaration normalization
   - Set operation semantic handling
   - Backward compatibility risks

2. **Test Performance Unknowns** (4-6 unknowns expected)
   - Parallelization race conditions
   - Slow test identification methodology
   - Worker count optimization
   - CI timeout handling
   - Fixture isolation requirements

3. **GAMSLib Integration Unknowns** (3-5 unknowns expected)
   - Parse rate improvement predictability
   - CI job execution time
   - Dashboard update automation reliability
   - Regression detection false positives

4. **Convexity Refinement Unknowns** (3-4 unknowns expected)
   - Line number tracking parser overhead
   - Fine-grained suppression implementation complexity
   - Context-aware heuristics feasibility
   - Documentation link generation automation

5. **CI/CD Unknowns** (2-3 unknowns expected)
   - Auto-commit workflow security
   - Parse rate regression thresholds
   - CI job trigger specificity

**Changes:**

Created comprehensive 9-model failure analysis with 7-feature impact matrix. Key findings:
- Identified 2 critical features (preprocessor directives, set range syntax) that unlock 3 models = 30% parse rate
- Calculated precise ROI for each feature (preprocessor: 2.9%/hour, set range: 2.5%/hour)
- Categorized all failures into 3 main categories: preprocessor (2 models), set features (1 model), statement-level (6 models)
- Recommended 2-phase Sprint 7 implementation: Phase 1 (preprocessor 6-8h) + Phase 2 (set range 3-4h) = 9-12 hours total

**Result:**

Deliverable created: `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/GAMSLIB_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md` (550+ lines)
- Detailed analysis of all 9 models with error context and root causes
- Feature impact matrix with complexity, effort, priority, and unlock rate
- Quick wins vs hard problems categorization
- Sprint 7 implementation plan with concrete steps
- Verified Unknown 1.3: 30% parse rate achievable with 2 features

## Task 2: Analyze GAMSLib Parser Failures

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Deadline:** 1 week before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Development team (Parser specialist)  
**Dependencies:** Task 1 (Known Unknowns)  
**Unknowns Verified:** 1.3, 3.1

### Objective

Perform detailed analysis of all 9 GAMSLib parser failures to categorize error types, identify high-impact features, and prioritize parser enhancements for Sprint 7.

### Why This Matters

Sprint 6 established 10% baseline but treating all parser gaps equally wastes effort. Some features may unlock multiple models (high ROI), while others unlock only one model (low ROI). Strategic prioritization is critical to achieving 30%+ parse rate.

**Key questions:**
- Which features appear in most failed models?
- What's the minimal feature set to unlock 2-3 additional models?
- Are there easy wins (simple syntax) vs hard problems (complex semantics)?
- Which failures are caused by missing features vs bugs in existing parser?

### Background

From `docs/status/GAMSLIB_CONVERSION_STATUS.md`:
- 9/10 models failed with `UnexpectedCharacters`
- `circle.gms`: Failed on `$if not set size $set size 10` (preprocessor)
- `himmel16.gms`: Failed on `Set i 'indices for the 6 points' / 1*6 /;` (range syntax)
- Other models: Unknown specific causes

Need systematic analysis to understand failure distribution across:
- Preprocessor directives (`$if`, `$set`, `$include`, `$ontext`, etc.)
- Set features (ranges, tuples, indexed sets)
- Parameter features (tables, multi-dimensional indexing)
- Statement types (display, option, assignment)

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Extract all parser error messages**

For each of the 9 failed models:
1. Locate model file in GAMSLib cache
2. Run parser with verbose error output
3. Capture: error message, line number, problematic syntax
4. Document in `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/GAMSLIB_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md`

```bash
# For each failed model (wrapped in subshell to preserve working directory)
(
  if [ ! -d "data/gamslib" ]; then
    echo "Error: data/gamslib/ directory does not exist. Please check your path."
    exit 1
  fi
  cd data/gamslib/
  for model in circle himmel16 hs62 mathopt1 maxmin mhw4dx mingamma rbrock trig; do
    echo "=== $model ===" >> failures.txt
    # Change to repo root to ensure src.cli is importable, then run parser
    (cd ../.. && python -m src.cli data/gamslib/${model}.gms 2>&1 | grep -A20 "UnexpectedCharacters") >> failures.txt
  done
)
```

**Step 2: Categorize failures by feature type**

Create taxonomy:
- **Preprocessor directives:** `$if`, `$set`, `$include`, `$ontext`/`$offtext`, `$call`, etc.
- **Set features:** Range syntax (`1*6`), tuples (`(i,j)`), indexed sets, set operations
- **Parameter features:** Table declarations, multi-dimensional indexing, data statements
- **Expression features:** Conditional expressions (`$(condition)`), special functions
- **Statement types:** Display, option, assignment, loop constructs

**Step 3: Build feature impact matrix**

| Feature | Models Blocked | Complexity | Est. Effort | Priority |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| `$if`/`$set` | 5-7 | High | 8-12h | Critical |
| Range syntax `1*6` | 3-4 | Medium | 4-6h | High |
| Multi-dim indexing | 2-3 | High | 6-8h | High |
| Table declarations | 1-2 | Medium | 4-6h | Medium |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step 4: Identify quick wins vs hard problems**

- **Quick wins:** Features with simple syntax, low semantic complexity, high model unlock count
- **Hard problems:** Features with complex semantics, deep IR changes, low model unlock count

**Step 5: Create recommended feature priority**

Based on:
1. Model unlock count (higher = better)
2. Implementation complexity (lower = better)
3. Foundation for future features (enabler features = higher priority)

**Changes:**

Created comprehensive 85-page research document analyzing GAMS preprocessor directive handling strategies. Key findings:
- Surveyed all 60+ GAMS dollar control options organized into 9 functional categories
- Analyzed GAMSLib test suite usage: only **3 directive types block parsing** (`$if not set`, `%macro%`, `$eolCom`)
- Only **2 models affected** (circle.gms, maxmin.gms) - all other failures are non-preprocessor issues
- Designed mock preprocessing approach requiring **no grammar changes** (preprocessing before parsing)
- Tested approach on 3 GAMSLib models: circle, maxmin, mhw4dx
- Compared 4 approaches: Full Preprocessor (40-60h), Mock (6-8h), Hybrid (12-15h), Skip (0h, insufficient)
- **Recommendation: Mock/skip approach** - achieves same +20% parse rate with 6-8h effort vs 40-60h for full preprocessing
- Documented implementation plan with 8 steps, unit test strategy, and quality checks
- Verified 3 Known Unknowns with concrete evidence and recommendations

**Result:**

Deliverable created: `docs/research/preprocessor_directives.md` (85 pages, 12 sections)
- **Section 1:** Background and current preprocessor status
- **Section 2:** Complete directive survey (60+ directives, usage frequency in GAMSLib)
- **Section 3:** Blocking analysis for circle.gms and maxmin.gms
- **Section 4:** Complexity analysis by category (Priority 1/2/3)
- **Section 5:** Mock handling approach design (3-function architecture, no grammar changes)
- **Section 6:** Grammar prototype decision (none needed - preprocessing removes directives)
- **Section 7:** Test results and expected preprocessing flow
- **Section 8:** Full vs Mock vs Hybrid comparison with effort/impact matrix
- **Section 9:** Detailed implementation plan for Sprint 7 (6-8 hours, 8 steps)
- **Section 10:** Limitations and warnings (command-line overrides, advanced conditionals, etc.)
- **Section 11:** Verification of Unknowns 1.1, 1.4, 1.11 with evidence and decisions
- **Section 12:** References and appendices (system constants, preprocessing examples)

Updated `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md`:
- **Unknown 1.1:** ✅ VERIFIED - Mock/skip approach is sufficient (6-8h vs 40-60h for full preprocessing)
- **Unknown 1.4:** ✅ VERIFIED - Preprocess before parsing, no grammar integration needed
- **Unknown 1.11:** ✅ VERIFIED - Include resolution NOT required (already implemented, orthogonal feature)

### Verification

## Task 3: Research Preprocessor Directive Handling

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Deadline:** 1 week before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Development team (Parser specialist)  
**Dependencies:** Task 2 (GAMSLib failure analysis) ✅  
**Unknowns Verified:** 1.1 ✅, 1.4 ✅, 1.11 ✅

### Objective

Research and design preprocessor directive handling strategy, comparing full preprocessing vs mock/skip approach, with concrete implementation plan for Sprint 7.

### Why This Matters

Preprocessor directives (`$if`, `$set`, `$include`) cause majority of GAMSLib failures. The handling strategy impacts:
- **Parser complexity:** Full preprocessing requires lexer/parser overhaul
- **Semantic correctness:** Mock handling may miss conditional code paths
- **Development time:** Full = weeks, Mock = days

Wrong choice could derail Sprint 7 or compromise correctness.

### Background

From Sprint 6 retrospective and GAMSLib analysis:
- Most failures due to `$if not set`, `$set`, `$include` directives
- Current parser treats `$` as unexpected character
- GAMS preprocessor is Turing-complete (supports macros, conditionals, file I/O)

**Two implementation approaches:**

**Option A: Full Preprocessing**
- Implement full GAMS preprocessor in Python
- Process directives before parsing
- Pros: Semantically correct, handles all directives
- Cons: Complex, weeks of work, out of scope for Sprint 7

**Option B: Mock/Skip Handling**
- Modify grammar to recognize and skip common directives
- Don't evaluate conditionals (assume true branch)
- Pros: Fast to implement, sufficient for many models
- Cons: May produce incorrect AST for complex conditional logic

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Survey GAMS preprocessor directives**

Catalog all GAMS preprocessor directives:
- Compile control: `$if`, `$ifI`, `$ifE`, `$else`, `$endif`
- Symbol definition: `$set`, `$setGlobal`, `$setLocal`, `$setEnv`
- File inclusion: `$include`, `$batInclude`, `$libInclude`
- Text blocks: `$ontext`, `$offtext`, `$comment`, `$onecho`, `$offecho`
- System calls: `$call`, `$echo`
- Options: `$onempty`, `$offempty`, `$on`/`$offOrder`

Identify which appear in GAMSLib failures.

**Step 2: Analyze directive complexity**

For each directive category:
- **Compile control:** Requires conditional AST construction
- **Symbol definition:** Requires symbol table with scoping
- **File inclusion:** Requires file system access and recursive parsing
- **Text blocks:** Requires lexer state management
- **System calls:** Requires subprocess execution (security risk)

Rank by complexity: Low (skip), Medium (mock), High (full preprocessing)

**Step 3: Prototype mock handling approach**

Design grammar modification to recognize and skip directives:

```lark
// Add to grammar
preprocessor_directive: "$" DIRECTIVE_NAME directive_args? NEWLINE
DIRECTIVE_NAME: "if" | "set" | "include" | "ontext" | "offtext" | ...
directive_args: /[^\n]+/

// In parser transformer
def preprocessor_directive(self, items):
    # Log directive seen, but don't process
    logger.debug(f"Skipping preprocessor directive: {items}")
    return None  # Omit from AST
```

Test on failed GAMSLib models:
- Does parser accept the file now?
- Does generated AST make sense?
- What breaks if we ignore conditionals?

**Step 4: Evaluate hybrid approach**

Consider hybrid: mock simple directives, fail on complex ones

- **Mock (safe):** `$set`, `$include` (if file exists), `$ontext`/`$offtext`
- **Fail (unsafe):** `$if`/`$else` (conditional logic), `$call` (side effects)
- Emit warning: "Preprocessor directive ignored, results may be incorrect"

**Step 5: Document recommendation**

Create `docs/research/preprocessor_directives.md`:
- Survey of directive types
- Complexity analysis
- Mock handling design (grammar changes, transformer updates)
- Test strategy
- Limitations and warnings
- Recommended approach for Sprint 7

**Changes:**

Completed comprehensive research on multi-dimensional indexing support in current IR implementation. Key findings:
- Surveyed 89 GAMS files across codebase: 71 use 1D indexing (96%), 7 use 2D indexing (4%), 0 use 3D+ indexing
- Analyzed current IR implementation in `src/ir/symbols.py`, `src/ir/ast.py`, `src/ad/index_mapping.py`
- **Discovered current IR already fully supports multi-dimensional indexing via tuple-based design**
- Verified normalization strategy preserves index semantics for nested sums (tested with test_simple_table.gms)
- Verified AD system handles multi-dim derivatives via tuple equality index matching
- Verified KKT module generates stationarity equations per instance correctly
- Identified parser blockers (set ranges `/ 1*6 /`, preprocessor directives `$if`) - not IR issues
- **Conclusion: 0 IR changes needed for Sprint 7** - current design supports arbitrary dimensions natively

**Result:**

Deliverable created: `docs/research/multidimensional_indexing.md` (comprehensive research document)
- **Section 1:** Background and current status (10% parse rate, 2 models with 2D indexing)
- **Section 2:** Pattern survey (frequency analysis: 96% 1D, 4% 2D, 0% 3D+)
- **Section 3:** Current IR design (tuple-based domains `domain: tuple[str, ...]` support arbitrary dimensions)

- **Section 5:** Derivative computation (tuple equality for index matching `idx == var_indices`)
- **Section 6:** Grammar analysis (multi-dim syntax already supported)
- **Section 7:** Impact analysis - **0 changes needed** across all modules (Parser, IR, Normalization, AD, KKT)
- **Section 8:** Test cases (simple 2D, nested sum, conditional domain, 3D stress test)
- **Section 9:** Implementation plan - **0 hours effort** (no changes required)
- **Section 10:** Conclusion and recommendations

Updated `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md`:
- **Unknown 1.2:** ✅ VERIFIED - Current IR fully supports multi-dim with zero refactoring needed
  - Tuple-based design (`domain: tuple[str, ...]`) handles 1D/2D/3D/ND natively
  - Cross-product enumeration in AD system works for arbitrary dimensions
  - Working test: test_simple_table.gms with 2D parameter
- **Unknown 1.6:** ✅ VERIFIED - KKT stationarity generation already handles multi-dim correctly
  - Iterates over `enumerate_variable_instances()` which supports arbitrary dimensions
  - Generates `stat_X(i,j)` for each instance via cross-product
  - Gradient computation uses tuple equality for index matching

## Task 4: Research Multi-Dimensional Set Indexing

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Deadline:** 1 week before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Development team  
**Dependencies:** Task 2 (GAMSLib failure analysis) ✅  
**Unknowns Verified:** 1.2 ✅, 1.6 ✅

### Objective

Research multi-dimensional set indexing requirements, design IR representation and normalization strategy, and create implementation plan for Sprint 7.

### Why This Matters

Multi-dimensional indexing is fundamental to real-world GAMS models but currently unsupported. Required for expressions like:

```gams
Set i, j;
Parameter A(i,j), B(i,j,k);
Variable X(i,j);
Equation eq(i);
eq(i).. sum(j, A(i,j) * X(i,j)) =e= 0;
```

Without this, most practical models fail to parse. GAMSLib analysis (Task 2) will quantify impact.

### Background

Current parser supports:
- Single-dimensional indexing: `Variable X(i);`
- Simple summations: `sum(i, expr)`

Current parser does NOT support:
- Multi-dimensional parameters: `Parameter A(i,j);`
- Multi-dimensional variables: `Variable X(i,j,k);`
- Multi-dimensional sets: `Set ij(i,j);`
- Nested indexing in expressions: `A(i,j) + B(j,k)`

This impacts IR, normalization, and KKT derivative computation.

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Survey multi-dimensional indexing patterns**

From GAMSLib failures and literature, identify:
1. Parameter indexing: `A(i,j,k)`
2. Variable indexing: `X(i,j)`
3. Set tuples: `Set ij(i,j);`
4. Conditional indexing: `A(i,j)$(i.val < j.val)`
5. Index mapping: `sum((i,j), ...)`

Prioritize by frequency in GAMSLib.

**Step 2: Design IR representation**

Current IR stores:
```python
Variable(name="X", indices=["i"])
```

Proposed IR:
```python
Variable(name="X", indices=["i", "j", "k"])  # Multiple indices
Index(name="i", set_name="I")  # Link to set
IndexedRef(symbol="A", indices=["i", "j"])  # Reference with indices
```

Must support:
- Multiple indices per symbol
- Index order preservation
- Set membership validation

**Step 3: Design normalization strategy**

How to normalize multi-dimensional expressions:

Example:
```gams
eq(i).. sum(j, A(i,j) * X(i,j)) =e= 0;
```

Normalized IR:
```python
Equation(
  name="eq",
  indices=["i"],
  expr=Sum(
    index="j",
    expr=BinaryOp(
      op="*",
      left=IndexedRef(symbol="A", indices=["i", "j"]),
      right=IndexedRef(symbol="X", indices=["i", "j"])
    )
  )
)
```

**Step 4: Identify derivative computation impacts**

How does multi-dimensional indexing affect AD?

Derivative of `A(i,j) * X(i,j)` w.r.t. `X(k,l)`:
- If `(i,j) == (k,l)`: `A(i,j)`
- Otherwise: `0`

Need index matching logic in AD module.

**Step 5: Create grammar modifications**

Update grammar to support:
```lark
indexed_ref: ID "(" index_list ")"
index_list: ID ("," ID)*
```

**Step 6: Document design**

Create `docs/research/multidimensional_indexing.md`:
- Pattern survey
- IR design
- Normalization strategy
- Derivative computation approach
- Grammar modifications
- Test strategy

**Changes:**

1. Created `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` (comprehensive 400+ line analysis)
2. Generated profiling data files:
   - `test_profile.txt` - Full pytest --durations=50 output
   - `test_times_sorted.txt` - All test times sorted by duration
3. Updated `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` with verification results for Unknowns 2.1, 2.3, 2.4

**Result:**

✅ **Profiling Complete - Sprint 7 Optimization Highly Achievable**

**Key Findings:**
- **Total execution time:** 208.41s (full suite), 176.90s (core tests)
- **Pareto confirmed:** Top 4 tests (1.3%) = 66.7% of execution time
- **Test distribution:**
  - Production tests: 4 tests, 94.08s (53.2%)
  - Benchmark tests: 6 tests, 39.86s (22.5%)
  - Integration tests: 45 tests, 24.76s (14.0%)
  - PATH solver tests: 15 tests, 4.18s (2.4% - not a bottleneck)
- **Parallelization potential:** 95%+ of tests can be parallelized safely
- **Expected speedup:** 3.4x (4 workers) to 6.0x (8 workers)
- **Sprint 7 goal (<60s):** HIGH achievability with pytest-xdist

**Unknowns Verified:**
- ✅ **Unknown 2.1:** Pareto principle confirmed (1.3% of tests = 67% of time)
- ✅ **Unknown 2.3:** PATH solver tests are isolated and only 2.4% of time
- ✅ **Unknown 2.4:** pytest-xdist overhead estimated at 15-25% (reasonable)

## Task 5: Profile Test Suite Performance

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Actual Time:** ~5 hours  
**Completed:** 2025-11-14  
**Owner:** Development team (Testing specialist)  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Unknowns Verified:** 2.1 ✅, 2.3 ✅, 2.4 ✅

### Objective

Profile full test suite to identify slow tests, categorize by type, and create baseline for Sprint 7 test performance optimization.

### Why This Matters

Sprint 6 test suite takes ~107 seconds for 1217 tests. Sprint 7 goal is <60s for fast tests, <120s for full suite. Without profiling data, optimization is guesswork.

**Key questions:**
- Which tests take >1 second?
- Are slow tests due to solver calls, file I/O, or computation?
- Can tests be parallelized safely?
- Which tests should be marked `@pytest.mark.slow`?

### Background

From Sprint 6:
- 1217 tests total
- Execution time: ~107 seconds (~88ms average per test)
- Some tests likely much slower (solver validation, golden files)
- No current profiling or slow test marking

From Sprint 6 retrospective:
- "Test execution time needs optimization (~107s for full suite)"
- "Profile slowest tests (likely validation tests with solver calls)"
- "Mark slow tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`"

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Run pytest with profiling**

```bash
# Profile full test suite
pytest --durations=50 > test_profile.txt

# Categorize test times
pytest --durations=0 | grep -E "^[0-9]" | sort -rn > test_times_sorted.txt
```

**Step 2: Categorize slow tests by type**

Group tests into categories:
- **Validation tests:** Tests calling GAMS/PATH solvers (likely slowest)
- **Golden file tests:** End-to-end tests comparing output files
- **Integration tests:** Cross-module tests
- **Unit tests:** Isolated component tests

For each category:
- Count of tests
- Total time
- Average time per test
- Slowest test

**Step 3: Identify parallelization blockers**

Analyze tests for:
- File I/O to shared locations (race condition risk)
- Global state mutations (test isolation issues)
- Subprocess calls (may need serialization)
- Solver calls (may have licensing limits)

**Step 4: Create test categorization strategy**

Design marking strategy:
```python
@pytest.mark.unit       # Fast, isolated (<100ms)
@pytest.mark.integration # Medium, cross-module (100ms-1s)
@pytest.mark.e2e        # Slower, end-to-end (1s-5s)
@pytest.mark.slow       # Slowest, solver calls (>5s)
```

**Step 5: Estimate parallelization speedup**

Calculate theoretical speedup:
- If 90% of time in 10% of tests: High speedup potential
- If evenly distributed: Low speedup potential

Estimate speedup for 4 workers, 8 workers.

**Step 6: Document findings**

Create `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`:
- Full test suite profile (50 slowest tests)
- Test categorization by type
- Parallelization blocker analysis
- Recommended marking strategy
- Speedup estimates
- Implementation plan for Sprint 7

**Changes:**

1. Created `docs/planning/EPIC_2/PARSER_ROADMAP.md` (comprehensive parser feature catalog and roadmap)
2. Cataloged **52 GAMS syntax features** across 5 categories:
   - Preprocessing & Macros: 7 features
   - Set Features: 9 features
   - Parameter & Data Features: 8 features
   - Variable & Equation Features: 10 features
   - Statement & Control Features: 18 features
3. Updated `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` with verification results for Unknowns 1.3, 1.9, 1.10

**Result:**

✅ **Complete Parser Roadmap for Sprints 8-10**

**Feature Catalog:**
- 52 GAMS features cataloged and analyzed
- Current support status documented (21 features already supported ✅)
- 31 features identified for future implementation

**GAMSLib Usage Analysis:**
- Cross-referenced 9 failed models with feature requirements
- No single feature dominates (steady progress across categories needed)
- Feature frequency: Preprocessor (22%), Model declaration (22%), Set range (11%), etc.

**ROI Rankings:**
- **Tier 1 (Excellent ROI >4.0):** Models keyword (10.0), Multiple scalars (6.7), Model declaration (4.0)
- **Tier 2 (Good ROI 2.0-4.0):** Variable attributes (3.3), Preprocessor (2.5), Set range (2.5), Option statements (2.5), Solve with objective (2.0)
- **Tier 3 (Moderate ROI 1.0-2.0):** Indexed assignments (1.7), Indexed sets (1.7)
- **Tier 4 (Low ROI <1.0):** Display, loops, file I/O, etc.

**Sprint Roadmaps:**
- **Sprint 8 (Wave 2):** 6 features, 19-28 hours, 60-70% parse rate (ROI: 1.7-2.4% per hour)
- **Sprint 9 (Wave 3):** 7 features, 18-25 hours, 80% parse rate (ROI: 0.3-0.6% per hour)
- **Sprint 10 (Wave 4):** 10 features, 36-49 hours, 90% parse rate (ROI: 0.2-0.3% per hour)
- **Total:** 110-150 hours to achieve 90% parse rate

**Dependency Graph:**
- No blocking circular dependencies
- Features mostly independent (can parallelize)
- Preprocessor features are foundational (many models use them)

**Unknowns Verified:**
- ✅ **Unknown 1.3:** Enhanced with roadmap insights - Sprint 7 target (30-40%) is conservative, clear path to 90% by Sprint 10
- ✅ **Unknown 1.9:** Equation attributes can be deferred to Sprint 9 (not blocking any models)
- ✅ **Unknown 1.10:** Assignments already supported for Sprint 7, enhance with indexed assignments in Sprint 8

### Verification

```bash
# Baseline document should exist
test -f docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md

## Task 6: Survey GAMS Syntax Features for Wave 2

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Actual Time:** ~5 hours  
**Completed:** 2025-11-14  
**Owner:** Development team (Parser specialist)  
**Dependencies:** Task 2 (GAMSLib failure analysis)  
**Unknowns Verified:** 1.3 ✅ (enhanced), 1.9 ✅, 1.10 ✅

### Objective

Survey GAMS syntax features beyond Sprint 7 scope to plan parser roadmap for Sprint 8+ and identify dependencies between features.

### Why This Matters

Sprint 7 focuses on preprocessor directives and multi-dimensional indexing (Wave 1). But GAMSLib models likely use many more features. Understanding the full landscape helps:
- Sequence features correctly (foundation features before dependent features)
- Estimate total parser work (Sprint 8, 9, 10 scoping)
- Identify diminishing returns (when to stop parser expansion)

### Background

From PROJECT_PLAN.md Sprint 8:
- "Multi-dimensional sets, equation attributes, conditional expressions, selected display/option statements"
- Target: ≥50% parse rate

Need to catalog all missing GAMS features and prioritize for Sprints 8-10.

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Catalog GAMS syntax features**

Survey GAMS documentation and GAMSLib models for:

**Set features:**
- Range syntax: `Set i /1*10/`
- Tuples: `Set ij(i,j)`
- Indexed sets: `Set active(i)`
- Set operations: `union`, `intersect`, `card`

**Parameter features:**
- Table declarations: `Table A(i,j) ...`
- Data statements: `Parameter A(i) /1 5, 2 10/`
- Conditional assignment: `A(i)$(i.val > 5) = ...`

**Variable/Equation features:**
- Attributes: `.l`, `.m`, `.lo`, `.up`
- Equation types: `=n=` (nonlinear), `=x=` (external)
- Equation attributes: `.range`, `.slack`

**Expression features:**
- Conditionals: `expr$(condition)`
- Special functions: `card()`, `ord()`, `smax()`, `smin()`
- Set membership: `i in Set`

**Statement features:**
- Assignments: `scalar x; x = 5;`
- Loops: `loop(i, ...)`
- Display: `display x;`
- Options: `option limrow = 0;`

**Step 2: Cross-reference with GAMSLib failures**

For each feature, identify:
- How many GAMSLib models use it?
- Is it a blocker for parsing or just for full semantics?
- Is it used in objective/constraints (critical) or just setup (less critical)?

**Step 3: Create dependency graph**

Some features depend on others:
- Conditional expressions depend on set membership
- Equation attributes depend on equation parsing
- Table declarations depend on multi-dimensional indexing

Build dependency graph to sequence features correctly.

**Step 4: Estimate effort and impact**

For each feature:
- **Effort:** Low (<4h), Medium (4-8h), High (8-16h), Very High (>16h)
- **Impact:** Number of models unlocked
- **ROI:** Impact / Effort

**Step 5: Create roadmap**

Group features into:
- **Sprint 7 (Wave 1):** Preprocessor, multi-dim indexing (already planned)
- **Sprint 8 (Wave 2):** Top 5 ROI features from analysis
- **Sprint 9 (Wave 3):** Next 5 ROI features
- **Sprint 10 (Wave 4):** Remaining features or diminishing returns

**Step 6: Document survey**

Create `docs/planning/EPIC_2/PARSER_ROADMAP.md`:
- Complete feature catalog
- GAMSLib usage analysis
- Dependency graph
- Effort/impact estimates
- Recommended roadmap for Sprints 7-10

**Changes:**

*To be completed*

**Result:**

## Task 7: Design Line Number Tracking for Warnings

**Status:** 🔵 NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Deadline:** Before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Development team  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Unknowns Verified:** 4.1

### Objective

Design approach to track line numbers through parser → IR → normalization → convexity detection pipeline, enabling warnings with line number citations.

### Why This Matters

From Sprint 6 Known Unknowns (deferred Unknown 1.7):
- Current convexity warnings don't cite line numbers
- Users can't easily locate problematic equations
- UX improvement: "W301 in equation 'circle_eq' (line 15)"

From Sprint 6 retrospective action items:
- "Add line numbers to convexity warnings"
- Medium priority for Sprint 7

### Background

Current warning format:
```
W301: Nonlinear equality constraint detected
   Equation: circle_eq
   Docs: https://...
```

Desired format:
```
W301: Nonlinear equality constraint detected
   Equation: circle_eq (line 15)
   Expression: x**2 + y**2 =e= 4
   Docs: https://...
```

Requires tracking line numbers from parse tree through IR transformations.

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Survey Lark parser line number support**

Lark provides meta information:
```python
from lark import Tree
tree.meta.line  # Line number
tree.meta.column  # Column number
```

Test: Can we access line numbers in transformer?

**Step 2: Design IR metadata**

Add metadata to IR nodes:
```python
@dataclass
class Equation:
    name: str
    expr: Expr
    eq_type: str
    indices: List[str]
    meta: Optional[Metadata] = None  # NEW

@dataclass
class Metadata:
    line: int
    column: int
    source_file: str
```

**Step 3: Track through normalization**

Normalization transforms IR. Must preserve metadata:
```python
def normalize_equation(eq: Equation) -> Equation:
    new_expr = normalize_expr(eq.expr)
    return Equation(
        name=eq.name,
        expr=new_expr,
        eq_type=eq.eq_type,
        indices=eq.indices,
        meta=eq.meta  # Preserve metadata
    )
```

**Step 4: Use in convexity detection**

```python
def detect_nonlinear_equality(eq: Equation) -> List[Warning]:
    if eq.eq_type == "=e=" and is_nonlinear(eq.expr):
        return [Warning(
            code="W301",
            equation=eq.name,
            line=eq.meta.line if eq.meta else None,  # Use line number
            column=eq.meta.column if eq.meta else None
        )]
    return []
```

**Step 5: Format warning output**

Update warning formatter to include line/column:
```python
def format_warning(warning: Warning) -> str:
    location = f" (line {warning.line})" if warning.line else ""
    return f"{warning.code}: {warning.message}\n" \
           f"   Equation: {warning.equation}{location}\n"
```

**Step 6: Handle edge cases**

- IR nodes created during normalization (no source location)
- Multi-line equations (which line to cite?)
- Included files (how to show file path?)

**Step 7: Document design**

Create `docs/design/line_number_tracking.md`:
- Parser metadata extraction
- IR metadata design
- Normalization metadata preservation
- Convexity detection usage
- Warning formatter updates
- Edge case handling

**Changes:**

*To be completed*

**Result:**

*To be completed*

### Verification

```bash
# Design document should exist
test -f docs/design/line_number_tracking.md

# Should contain required sections
grep -q "Parser Metadata" docs/design/line_number_tracking.md
grep -q "IR Metadata" docs/design/line_number_tracking.md
grep -q "Normalization" docs/design/line_number_tracking.md
```

### Deliverables

- `docs/design/line_number_tracking.md` (design document)
- IR metadata structure design
- Normalization metadata preservation strategy
- Warning formatter updates
- Edge case handling approach
- Implementation plan for Sprint 7
- Updated `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` with verification results for Unknown 4.1

- [ ] IR metadata structure designed
- [ ] Normalization preservation strategy documented
- [ ] Warning formatter updates specified
- [ ] Edge cases identified and solutions proposed
- [ ] Implementation effort estimated (Medium priority for Sprint 7)
- [ ] Unknown 4.1 verified and updated in KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md

## Task 8: Set Up CI for GAMSLib Regression Tracking

**Status:** 🔵 NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours  
**Deadline:** Before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** DevOps/Development team  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Unknowns Verified:** 3.2, 3.3, 5.1

### Objective

Design CI workflow for automated GAMSLib ingestion, dashboard updates, and parse rate regression detection.

### Why This Matters

From Sprint 6 retrospective:
- "GAMSLib dashboard updates currently manual (need CI automation)"
- "No regression tracking (can't detect if parse rate drops)"

Manual process risks:
- Forgetting to re-run after parser changes
- No continuous monitoring of benchmark progress
- Silent regressions (parse rate drops unnoticed)

### Background

Current process:
1. Developer runs `make ingest-gamslib` manually
2. Dashboard `docs/status/GAMSLIB_CONVERSION_STATUS.md` generated
3. Developer commits dashboard (or forgets)
4. No alerting if parse rate decreases

Desired process:
1. PR modifies parser code
2. CI automatically runs GAMSLib ingestion
3. Dashboard auto-updated (or CI fails if not committed)
4. CI fails if parse rate drops >10% (regression detection)

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Design CI trigger strategy**

Options:
- **Option A:** Run on every PR (thorough but slow)
- **Option B:** Run only on parser-related file changes
- **Option C:** Run on schedule (nightly) + parser changes

Recommended: Option B (parser changes) + Option C (weekly scheduled run)

Trigger files:
- `src/gams/grammar.lark`
- `src/gams/parser.py`
- `src/ir/*.py` (if parser depends on IR)

**Step 2: Design CI job workflow**

```yaml
name: GAMSLib Regression Check

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/gams/grammar.lark'
      - 'src/gams/parser.py'
      - 'src/ir/*.py'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday

jobs:
  gamslib-ingestion:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -e .
      
      - name: Run GAMSLib ingestion
        run: make ingest-gamslib
      
      - name: Check for dashboard changes
        run: |
          if git diff --quiet docs/status/GAMSLIB_CONVERSION_STATUS.md; then
            echo "No dashboard changes detected - skipping parse rate check"
          else
            echo "Dashboard changes detected - checking parse rate..."
          fi
      
      - name: Detect parse rate regression
        run: python scripts/check_parse_rate_regression.py
      
      - name: Upload dashboard artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: gamslib-dashboard
          path: docs/status/GAMSLIB_CONVERSION_STATUS.md
```

**Step 3: Design regression detection script**

Create `scripts/check_parse_rate_regression.py`:
```python
# Note: This is a design example. Helper functions like read_parse_rate() and 
# read_parse_rate_from_main() need to be implemented with proper error handling.

import sys
import json
from pathlib import Path

def read_parse_rate(json_path: str) -> float:
    """
    Read parse rate from GAMSLib ingestion JSON report.
    
    Args:
        json_path: Path to JSON report file
        
    Returns:
        Parse rate as float (e.g., 30.0 for 30%)
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If JSON file doesn't exist
        json.JSONDecodeError: If JSON is malformed
        KeyError: If expected parse_rate field is missing
    """
    # TODO: Implement with error handling
    pass

def read_parse_rate_from_main() -> float:
    """
    Read baseline parse rate from main branch.
    
    Fetches the latest JSON report from main branch using git show.
    
    Returns:
        Baseline parse rate as float (e.g., 10.0 for 10%)
        
    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If git command fails
        FileNotFoundError: If baseline file doesn't exist on main
        json.JSONDecodeError: If baseline JSON is malformed
        KeyError: If expected parse_rate field is missing
    """
    # TODO: Implement using subprocess.run(['git', 'show', 'main:reports/...'])
    pass

def check_regression():
    # Read current parse rate from JSON report
    current_rate = read_parse_rate("reports/gamslib_ingestion_sprint7.json")
    
    # Read baseline from main branch
    baseline_rate = read_parse_rate_from_main()
    
    # Check for regression (>10% drop)
    if current_rate < baseline_rate * 0.9:
        print(f"REGRESSION: Parse rate dropped from {baseline_rate}% to {current_rate}%")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print(f"OK: Parse rate {current_rate}% (baseline {baseline_rate}%)")
```

**Step 4: Design auto-commit strategy**

Options:
- **Option A:** CI auto-commits dashboard changes (requires write permission)
- **Option B:** CI fails if dashboard not committed (developer commits manually)
- **Option C:** CI posts comment with dashboard diff (no auto-commit)

Recommended: Option B (fail if not committed) for security/transparency

**Step 5: Handle CI timeout**

GAMSLib ingestion should complete in <5 minutes. If timeout:
- Cache downloaded GAMSLib models
- Limit to top 10-20 models (not full suite)
- Parallelize ingestion

**Step 6: Document CI design**

Create `docs/ci/gamslib_regression_tracking.md`:
- Trigger strategy
- CI job workflow
- Regression detection logic
- Auto-commit strategy
- Timeout handling
- Implementation plan

**Changes:**

*To be completed*

**Result:**

## Task 9: Create Parser Test Fixture Strategy

**Status:** 🔵 NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Deadline:** Before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Development team (Testing specialist)  
**Dependencies:** Tasks 2, 3, 4 (parser research)  
**Unknowns Verified:** Uses findings from Tasks 2, 3, 4 to design comprehensive test coverage

### Objective

Design test fixture strategy for new parser features (preprocessor, multi-dimensional indexing), ensuring comprehensive coverage without test bloat.

### Why This Matters

Sprint 7 adds complex parser features. Without systematic test fixture design:
- Tests duplicate effort (same patterns tested multiple times)
- Edge cases missed (untested combinations)
- Test maintenance burden (hard to update)
- Unclear coverage (which features are tested?)

Need structured approach to test fixtures.

### Background

From Sprint 6:
- 1217 tests total
- Convexity tests used `tests/fixtures/convexity/` with 18 models + README
- Good model: Organized fixtures with expected results documented

Sprint 7 will add:
- Preprocessor directive tests
- Multi-dimensional indexing tests
- Advanced GAMS feature tests

Need unified strategy across all parser features.

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Review existing test fixtures**

Catalog current fixtures:
- `tests/fixtures/convexity/` - 18 models, expected results in YAML
- `tests/golden/` - End-to-end golden files
- `examples/` - Example models (not systematic tests)

Identify patterns:
- Fixture organization (by feature)
- Expected results documentation (YAML, README)
- Positive vs negative tests

**Step 2: Design fixture hierarchy**

Proposed structure:
```
tests/fixtures/
  convexity/           # Existing
  preprocessor/        # NEW Sprint 7
    simple_set.gms     # $set directive
    conditional.gms    # $if/$else
    include.gms        # $include
    text_block.gms     # $ontext/$offtext
    expected.yaml      # Expected parse results
    README.md          # Fixture documentation
  multidim/            # NEW Sprint 7
    parameter_2d.gms   # Parameter A(i,j)
    variable_3d.gms    # Variable X(i,j,k)
    nested_sum.gms     # sum((i,j), ...)
    expected.yaml
    README.md
  advanced/            # NEW Sprint 7 (Wave 2 prep)
    table_decl.gms
    set_range.gms
    expected.yaml
    README.md
```

**Step 3: Design expected results format**

Use YAML for expected results:
```yaml
# tests/fixtures/preprocessor/expected.yaml
simple_set:
  should_parse: true
  symbols_defined:
    - name: size
      type: scalar
      value: 10
  warnings: []

conditional:
  should_parse: true
  branches_taken:
    - if: true
    - else: false
  warnings:
    - "Preprocessor directive ignored, assuming true branch"
```

**Step 4: Design test case generation**

Use parametrized tests:
```python
import pytest
import yaml

@pytest.fixture
def preprocessor_fixtures():
    with open("tests/fixtures/preprocessor/expected.yaml") as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("fixture_name", [
    "simple_set",
    "conditional",
    "include",
    "text_block"
])
def test_preprocessor_parsing(fixture_name, preprocessor_fixtures):
    model_path = f"tests/fixtures/preprocessor/{fixture_name}.gms"
    expected = preprocessor_fixtures[fixture_name]
    
    # Test parsing
    result = parse_file(model_path)
    assert result.success == expected["should_parse"]
    
    # Test symbols
    if expected["should_parse"]:
        for symbol in expected["symbols_defined"]:
            assert symbol["name"] in result.symbols
```

**Step 5: Design fixture documentation**

Each fixture directory needs README.md:
- Purpose of fixtures
- How to add new fixtures
- How to update expected results
- Cross-references to features tested

**Step 6: Identify coverage gaps**

From Tasks 2, 3, 4 research, identify:
- Which parser features need fixtures?
- How many test cases per feature?
- Which combinations need testing?

Create coverage matrix:
| Feature | Simple | Nested | Error | Total |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Preprocessor $set | ✅ | - | ✅ | 2 |
| Preprocessor $if | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 3 |
| Multi-dim param | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 3 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step 7: Document strategy**

Create `docs/testing/PARSER_FIXTURE_STRATEGY.md`:
- Fixture hierarchy
- Expected results format
- Test case generation approach
- Fixture documentation requirements
- Coverage matrix
- Implementation checklist for Sprint 7

## Task 10: Plan Sprint 7 Detailed Schedule

**Status:** 🔵 NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Deadline:** Before Sprint 7 Day 1  
**Owner:** Sprint planning team  
**Dependencies:** All tasks (1-9)  
**Unknowns Verified:** Integrates all verified unknowns from Tasks 1-9 into detailed sprint plan

### Objective

Create detailed day-by-day Sprint 7 plan (`docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PLAN.md`) with tasks, checkpoints, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.

### Why This Matters

Sprint 6 demonstrated that detailed daily plans with checkpoints prevent scope creep and ensure steady progress. Sprint 7 has more complexity (parser internals) requiring even more careful planning.

**Goals for Sprint 7 plan:**
- 11-day structure (Days 0-10) like Sprint 6
- 5 checkpoints to validate progress
- Clear acceptance criteria for each day
- Realistic effort estimates based on prep research

### Background

From Sprint 6 retrospective:
- "Day-by-day plan kept sprint on track"
- "Clear checkpoints validated progress"
- "Prep week tasks eliminated ambiguity"

Sprint 7 has 4 major goals:
1. Parser enhancements (30% GAMSLib parse rate)
2. Test performance (<60s fast suite)
3. Convexity refinements (line numbers, fine-grained suppression)
4. CI integration (automated dashboard)

Must sequence tasks correctly:
- Parser features before GAMSLib retest
- Test profiling before parallelization
- Research before implementation

### What Needs to Be Done

**Step 1: Review all prep task results**

Consolidate findings from Tasks 1-9:
- Known unknowns (Task 1)
- GAMSLib failure analysis (Task 2)
- Preprocessor directive design (Task 3)
- Multi-dimensional indexing design (Task 4)
- Test performance baseline (Task 5)
- Parser roadmap (Task 6)
- Line number tracking design (Task 7)
- CI design (Task 8)
- Test fixture strategy (Task 9)

**Step 2: Create day-by-day breakdown**

Proposed Sprint 7 schedule (11 days):

**Week 1: Parser Enhancements**
- Day 0: Pre-sprint setup, final prep review
- Day 1: Preprocessor directive implementation (mock approach)
- Day 2: Multi-dimensional set indexing (IR + grammar)
- Day 3: Multi-dimensional set indexing (normalization + AD)
- Day 4: Advanced GAMS features (table declarations, set ranges)
- Day 5: GAMSLib retest and parser validation
- **Checkpoint 1 (Day 5 EOD):** GAMSLib parse rate ≥30%

**Week 2: Optimization & Quality**
- Day 6: Test profiling and marking (slow tests)
- Day 7: Test parallelization (pytest-xdist)
- Day 8: Convexity refinements (line numbers, fine-grained suppression)
- Day 9: CI integration (GAMSLib regression tracking)
- **Checkpoint 2 (Day 9 EOD):** All quality metrics met
- Day 10: Sprint review, retrospective, release prep

**Step 3: Define checkpoints**

5 checkpoints:
1. **Checkpoint 0 (Day 0):** Prep tasks complete, Known Unknowns reviewed
2. **Checkpoint 1 (Day 5):** Parser enhancements complete, GAMSLib ≥30%
3. **Checkpoint 2 (Day 7):** Test suite <60s (fast), <120s (full)
4. **Checkpoint 3 (Day 9):** All features integrated, CI working
5. **Checkpoint 4 (Day 10):** Sprint 7 complete, v0.7.0 released

**Step 4: Define acceptance criteria**

For each day:
- Specific deliverables (files created/modified)
- Test coverage (new tests added)
- Quality checks (all passing)
- Integration validation (features work together)

Example (Day 1):
- [ ] Grammar updated to recognize preprocessor directives
- [ ] Transformer skips or mocks directives
- [ ] 10+ tests for common directive patterns
- [ ] All existing tests still pass (zero regressions)
- [ ] At least 1 additional GAMSLib model parses

**Step 5: Estimate effort and risk**

For each day:
- Estimated hours (6-8h per day)
- Risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Mitigation strategy if high risk

**Step 6: Cross-reference with PROJECT_PLAN.md**

Ensure Sprint 7 plan aligns with:
- PROJECT_PLAN.md Sprint 7 components
- PRELIMINARY_PLAN.md goals
- Known Unknowns verification tasks

**Step 7: Create PLAN.md document**

Following Sprint 6 PLAN.md format:
- Executive summary
- Sprint goals
- Day-by-day breakdown (Days 0-10)
- Checkpoints with acceptance criteria
- Deliverables list
- Success criteria
- Risk register

# Should have 11 days (Days 0-10)
[ "$(grep -c "^### Day [0-9]" docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PLAN.md)" -eq 11 ]

# Cross-references should exist
grep -q "PROJECT_PLAN.md" docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PLAN.md
grep -q "KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md" docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_7/PLAN.md
```
