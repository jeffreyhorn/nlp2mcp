# Sprint 4 Plan Review (Revised Plan)

## Findings
- PREP_PLAN Task 3 (“Set Up PATH Solver Validation”) is not called out as a late-sprint follow-on item, so the plan still violates the requirement to keep the PATH setup work separate from main tasks until the license arrives.
- Day-level workloads remain 9–10 hours (e.g., Days 5 and 10 are 10h, others 9h including checkpoints), leaving little slack for overruns on critical path items.
- Daily task sections reference prerequisite Unknowns as “COMPLETE ✅” but no longer summarize their findings or key architectural notes, which the instructions explicitly requested.
- Although PATH-focused Unknowns are confined to Day 8, the day still carries 8 hours of planned work plus a 1-hour checkpoint, keeping the high-risk validation day over the desired 8-hour cap.

## Recommendations
- Add an explicit “Follow-On Items” entry for PREP_PLAN Task 3 on Day 7 or Day 8 (after core work) so PATH environment setup is clearly scheduled once licensing becomes available.
- Rebalance the day-by-day estimates to stay at or below 8 hours (including checkpoints), moving lower-risk documentation or polish items from Days 5 and 10 into earlier buffers where possible.
- Reintroduce concise summaries from `KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md` for each referenced Unknown (even when complete), capturing findings, architectural implications, and status to satisfy the sprint planning instructions.
- Trim Day 8 implementation scope (e.g., shift documentation of PATH options to Day 7 or 9) so the solver-validation workload plus checkpoint fits within an 8-hour window.*** End Patch
