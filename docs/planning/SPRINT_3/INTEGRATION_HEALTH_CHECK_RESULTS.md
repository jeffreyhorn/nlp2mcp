## Critical Blocker Analysis

### Issue: Jacobian Index Mapping Mismatch

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: 40% of example models fail to process  
**Location**: `src/kkt/stationarity.py:153`

#### Problem
The stationarity builder assumes all `row_id` values in `jacobian.entries` have corresponding entries in `jacobian.index_mapping.row_to_eq`, but this assumption is violated for some models.

#### Affected Models
- `bounds_nlp.gms`: Fails at row_id=2
- `nonlinear_mix.gms`: Fails at row_id=3

#### Root Cause Hypothesis
1. **Normalized bounds**: Bounds get converted to inequality constraints, which may create rows in the Jacobian that aren't properly registered in `row_to_eq`
2. **Index mapping construction**: The index mapping may not be correctly built for all inequality types

#### Impact on Sprint 3
- **Blocks Day 8**: Cannot generate golden tests if 40% of examples fail
- **Blocks Day 9**: Cannot document if examples don't work
- **Blocks Day 10**: Cannot complete sprint with critical bugs

**Status**: All passing (17/17)
- Sparse gradient contracts ✅
- Jacobian structure contracts ✅
- ModelIR contracts ✅
- Differentiation API contracts ✅
- High-level API contracts ✅

### ✅ Sprint 1 Tests (Parser & IR)
**Status**: All passing (35/35)

- Parameters correctly emitted
- Variables correctly emitted

### ✅ No Infinite Bound Multipliers
**Status**: 3/3 passing examples verified

## Required Actions

### CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Proceeding

#### 1. Fix Jacobian Index Mapping Issue
**Priority**: P0 (BLOCKER)  
**Owner**: Development team  
**Deadline**: Before Day 8

**Action Items**:
1. Investigate why `row_to_eq` doesn't have entries for all row_ids
2. Debug bounds_nlp.gms step-by-step to find where mapping breaks
3. Fix index mapping construction in Jacobian or constraint partitioning
4. Add defensive checks in stationarity builder for missing keys
5. Add regression test for this specific case

#### 2. Verify Indexed Bounds
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)  
**Owner**: Development team  
**Deadline**: After fix, before Day 8

**Action Items**:
1. Create or identify example with indexed variable bounds
2. Verify indexed bounds create correct multipliers
3. Add to integration health check

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **STOP** progress on Day 8 until blocker resolved
2. Debug and fix Jacobian index mapping issue
3. Re-run integration health check
4. Only proceed to Day 8 when all 5 examples pass

### Short-term Actions (Day 8)
1. Add more robust error handling in stationarity builder
2. Add integration test specifically for bounds_nlp and nonlinear_mix
3. Verify all 5 examples in golden test suite

### Process Improvements
1. **Lesson Learned**: Integration health checks should run earlier
2. **Recommendation**: Add integration health check to CI pipeline
3. **Recommendation**: Test all examples after each major feature addition

## Revised Sprint Status

### Previous Assessment
- ✅ All systems green
- ✅ 70% complete
- ✅ On track

### Initial Assessment (Before Fix)
- ❌ **CRITICAL BLOCKER FOUND**
- ⏸️ **Sprint PAUSED** until blocker resolved
- ⚠️ **At Risk** of missing Day 10 deadline

### Impact (Before Fix)
- **Days 8-10**: Cannot proceed until issue fixed
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
- **Risk Level**: HIGH (40% of examples failing)

---

## Resolution

### Fix Implementation
**Time to Fix**: ~1 hour (faster than estimated)  
**Commit**: `022c992`  
**Files Modified**:
- `src/ad/constraint_jacobian.py` - Added `_build_inequality_index_mapping()` helper
- Preserved base mapping for equations, extended with bound rows
- Maintained num_eqs consistency for models without bounds

### Root Cause Analysis
The `build_index_mapping()` function only processes equations in `model.equations`, but normalized bounds are stored separately in `model.normalized_bounds`. When `_compute_bound_jacobian()` added rows to J_ineq for bounds, those row IDs didn't have corresponding entries in the index mapping's `row_to_eq` dictionary.

### Solution Details
Created `_build_inequality_index_mapping()` to extend the base index mapping:
1. Copies all variable and equation mappings from base
2. Adds `row_to_eq` entries for each normalized bound
3. Preserves `num_eqs` for models without bounds
4. Increments `num_eqs` only when bounds are added

### Verification After Fix
- ✅ All 588 tests passing (0 regressions)
- ✅ Integration health check: 5/5 examples (100% success rate)
- ✅ bounds_nlp.gms: KeyError: 2 → RESOLVED
- ✅ nonlinear_mix.gms: KeyError: 3 → RESOLVED
- ✅ Index mapping consistency test: PASSING

## Final Conclusion

The integration health check successfully identified a critical issue that would have blocked Sprint 3 completion. **The issue was immediately diagnosed and fixed during the same checkpoint session**, restoring the sprint to green status.

### Final Assessment (After Fix)
- ✅ **All systems green**
- ✅ **70% complete**
- ✅ **On track for Day 10 completion**
- ✅ **Zero blockers**

**Status**: ✅ INTEGRATION HEALTH CHECK PASSED - BLOCKER RESOLVED
