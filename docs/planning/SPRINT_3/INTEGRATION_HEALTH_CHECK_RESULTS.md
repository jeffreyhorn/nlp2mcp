### ❌ bounds_nlp.gms - FAILED
**Error**: KeyError: 2 in stationarity.py line 153

```
File "/src/kkt/stationarity.py", line 153
    eq_name, eq_indices = jacobian.index_mapping.row_to_eq[row_id]
KeyError: 2
```

**Root Cause**: Index mapping mismatch between Jacobian structure and row_to_eq dictionary.

### ❌ nonlinear_mix.gms - FAILED
**Error**: KeyError: 3 in stationarity.py line 153

```
File "/src/kkt/stationarity.py", line 153
    eq_name, eq_indices = jacobian.index_mapping.row_to_eq[row_id]
KeyError: 3
```

**Root Cause**: Index mapping mismatch between Jacobian structure and row_to_eq dictionary.

## Critical Blocker Analysis

### Issue: Jacobian Index Mapping Mismatch

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: 40% of example models fail to process  
**Location**: `src/kkt/stationarity.py:153`

#### Problem
The stationarity builder assumes all `row_id` values in `jacobian.entries` have corresponding entries in `jacobian.index_mapping.row_to_eq`, but this assumption is violated for some models.

#### Affected Models
- `bounds_nlp.gms`: Fails at row_id=2
- `nonlinear_mix.gms`: Fails at row_id=3

#### Root Cause Hypothesis
1. **Normalized bounds**: Bounds get converted to inequality constraints, which may create rows in the Jacobian that aren't properly registered in `row_to_eq`
2. **Index mapping construction**: The index mapping may not be correctly built for all inequality types

#### Impact on Sprint 3
- **Blocks Day 8**: Cannot generate golden tests if 40% of examples fail
- **Blocks Day 9**: Cannot document if examples don't work
- **Blocks Day 10**: Cannot complete sprint with critical bugs

## Regression Test Results

### ✅ API Contract Tests
**Status**: All passing (17/17)
- Sparse gradient contracts ✅
- Jacobian structure contracts ✅
- ModelIR contracts ✅
- Differentiation API contracts ✅
- High-level API contracts ✅

### ✅ Sprint 1 Tests (Parser & IR)
**Status**: All passing (35/35)
- Parser tests ✅
- Normalization tests ✅
- IR structure tests ✅

### ✅ Sprint 2 Tests (AD Engine)
**Status**: All passing (336/336)
- Unit AD tests ✅
- Integration AD tests ✅
- Validation tests ✅

**Conclusion**: No regressions in Sprint 1/2 code. Issue is specific to Sprint 3 KKT assembly.

## Verification Checks (For Passing Examples)

### ✅ Original Symbols Included
**Status**: 3/3 passing examples verified  
- Sets correctly emitted when present
- Parameters correctly emitted
- Variables correctly emitted

### ✅ No Infinite Bound Multipliers
**Status**: 3/3 passing examples verified  
- No infinite bounds in test examples, but mechanism verified
- Skipped bounds list correctly populated

### ✅ Objective Variable Handling
**Status**: 3/3 passing examples verified  
- No stationarity equation for objective variable
- Objective variable appears in Model MCP declaration
- Objective defining equation correctly paired with objvar

### ✅ Duplicate Bounds Excluded (Finding #1)
**Status**: 3/3 passing examples verified  
- No duplicate bounds in test examples
- Exclusion mechanism in place and functional

### ⚠️ Indexed Bounds Handled (Finding #2)
**Status**: Cannot fully verify  
- None of the passing examples have indexed bounds
- Need to test with model that has indexed bounds
- **Action**: Create test case with indexed bounds

### ✅ Variable Kinds Preserved (Finding #4)
**Status**: 3/3 passing examples verified  
- simple_nlp has Positive Variables correctly emitted
- Other examples have no special kinds (correctly handled)

## Required Actions

### CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Proceeding

#### 1. Fix Jacobian Index Mapping Issue
**Priority**: P0 (BLOCKER)  
**Owner**: Development team  
**Deadline**: Before Day 8

**Action Items**:
1. Investigate why `row_to_eq` doesn't have entries for all row_ids
2. Debug bounds_nlp.gms step-by-step to find where mapping breaks
3. Fix index mapping construction in Jacobian or constraint partitioning
4. Add defensive checks in stationarity builder for missing keys
5. Add regression test for this specific case

#### 2. Verify Indexed Bounds
**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)  
**Owner**: Development team  
**Deadline**: After fix, before Day 8

**Action Items**:
1. Create or identify example with indexed variable bounds
2. Verify indexed bounds create correct multipliers
3. Add to integration health check

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **STOP** progress on Day 8 until blocker resolved
2. Debug and fix Jacobian index mapping issue
3. Re-run integration health check
4. Only proceed to Day 8 when all 5 examples pass

### Short-term Actions (Day 8)
1. Add more robust error handling in stationarity builder
2. Add integration test specifically for bounds_nlp and nonlinear_mix
3. Verify all 5 examples in golden test suite

### Process Improvements
1. **Lesson Learned**: Integration health checks should run earlier
2. **Recommendation**: Add integration health check to CI pipeline
3. **Recommendation**: Test all examples after each major feature addition

## Revised Sprint Status

### Previous Assessment
- ✅ All systems green
- ✅ 70% complete
- ✅ On track

### Revised Assessment
- ❌ **CRITICAL BLOCKER FOUND**
- ⏸️ **Sprint PAUSED** until blocker resolved
- ⚠️ **At Risk** of missing Day 10 deadline

### Impact
- **Days 8-10**: Cannot proceed until issue fixed
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
- **Risk Level**: HIGH (40% of examples failing)

---

## Conclusion

The integration health check successfully identified a critical issue that would have blocked Sprint 3 completion. The issue affects 40% of example models and must be resolved before proceeding with Days 8-10.

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix Jacobian index mapping issue in stationarity builder
2. Re-run integration health check until all 5 examples pass
3. Add regression tests for the fixed issue
4. Only then proceed with Day 8 (Golden Test Suite)

**Status**: ❌ INTEGRATION HEALTH CHECK FAILED - BLOCKER IDENTIFIED

**Report Generated**: 2025-10-30  
**Blocker Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Required Action**: Fix before proceeding to Day 8
