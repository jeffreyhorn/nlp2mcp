---

## What Needs Improvement / Did Not Go Well

### 1. GitHub Issue #47 - Indexed Stationarity Equations ❌❌❌

**The Problem:**
- **Incorrect Assumption:** Indexed equations in GAMS MCP Model declaration use syntax `eq(i).var(i)`
- **Actual Requirement:** Indexed equations listed without indices: `eq.var` (indexing implicit)
- **Discovery:** Day 8 during golden test validation
- **Impact:** 2 days of emergency refactoring, complete stationarity.py rewrite

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Assumed too much about GAMS MCP syntax without testing
2. No simple MCP example created to validate syntax assumptions
3. Testing delayed until Day 8 (should have tested Day 1-2)
4. Documentation reading was insufficient (needed hands-on validation)

**Timeline:**
- Day 2: Implemented element-specific stationarity (stat_x_i1, stat_x_i2)
- Day 8: Golden tests revealed GAMS syntax errors
- Day 8-9: Emergency debugging and Issue #47 created
- Post-sprint: Major refactoring to indexed equations (stat_x(i))

**Code Impact:**
- Complete rewrite of `src/kkt/stationarity.py` (~170 lines affected)
- New functions: `_build_indexed_stationarity_expr`, `_replace_indices_in_expr`
- Updated: `src/emit/model.py` to remove indices from Model pairs
- Test updates: All stationarity tests required changes

**Cost:**
- Time: ~2 days (20% of sprint)
- Stress: High (emergency fix near sprint end)
- Rework: Complete module rewrite
- Testing: 10+ tests needed updates

**Why It Hurt:**
- Late discovery (Day 8) left little time for fixes
- Affected multiple components (stationarity, emission, tests)
- Required deep understanding of GAMS MCP semantics
- Blocked golden test validation temporarily

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Day 1: Create minimal MCP example with indexed variables
- Day 1: Test with GAMS compiler (even without PATH solver)
- Day 2: Validate generated syntax before full implementation
- Day 3: Incremental testing with increasing complexity

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Never assume code generation syntax without compiler validation**
- **Test with target system (GAMS) early, not late**
- **Create minimal examples first, complex features second**
- **Compiler feedback is essential for code generation projects**

---

### 2. Late GAMS Validation Setup ❌❌

**The Problem:**
- GAMS syntax validation not set up until Day 9
- Could have caught Issue #47 much earlier
- No compiler feedback during Days 1-8

**Impact:**
- Issue #47 discovered late (Day 8)
- No incremental syntax validation during development
- Uncertainty about whether generated code was valid

**Why It Happened:**
- GAMS compiler availability unclear at sprint start
- Validation tests not prioritized early
- Assumed syntax was correct based on documentation reading
- Optional validation delayed as "nice to have"

**What Should Have Happened:**
- PREP_PLAN should have included validation environment setup
- Day 1: Install GAMS or set up Docker container with GAMS
- Day 2: First syntax validation test
- Daily: Run GAMS compile-check on generated output

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Validation environment setup is Day 0 work, not Day 9**
- **For code generation, compiler feedback is not optional**
- **"Optional" validation should be "essential" for syntax correctness**

---

### 3. Retrospective Documentation Created Post-Sprint ❌

**The Problem:**
- Known unknowns list created AFTER sprint (retrospectively)
- Should have been created BEFORE sprint (proactively)
- Assumptions not explicitly documented until after problems occurred

**Impact:**
- Issue #47 could have been avoided with upfront unknown documentation
- Assumptions were implicit, not explicit
- No systematic verification of assumptions during planning

**Example:**
- Known Unknown document lists GAMS MCP syntax as an unknown
- But this was created AFTER Issue #47, not before
- If created before sprint, would have prompted early validation

**Why It Happened:**
- PREP_PLAN Task 10 not completed before sprint start
- Time pressure to start coding
- Assumed planning reviews were sufficient

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Week before sprint: Complete ALL PREP_PLAN tasks
- Create known unknowns list with verification plan for each
- Document ALL assumptions explicitly
- Plan validation steps for critical unknowns

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Known unknowns lists are proactive tools, not retrospective documentation**
- **Assumptions must be explicit and testable**
- **PREP_PLAN tasks are prerequisites, not nice-to-haves**

---

### 4. Test Organization Not Improved ❌

**The Problem:**
- PREP_PLAN Task 3 (test reorganization) not completed
- Tests remain in flat structure
- 602 tests in same-level directories

**Impact:**
- Slower test discovery
- No clear test pyramid visualization
- Harder to run just unit tests or just integration tests

**Current State:**
```
tests/
  unit/ad/...          (206 tests)
  integration/ad/...   (59 tests)
  e2e/...              (140 tests)
  validation/...       (42 tests)
```

**Desired State:**
```
tests/
  unit/               (fast, focused)
  integration/        (component interaction)
  e2e/                (full pipeline)
  validation/         (external system checks)
```

**Why It Happened:**
- Not prioritized during sprint
- Tests work fine in current structure
- No pain point forcing reorganization

**Impact Level:** Low (tests work, just not optimal)

**What Should Happen:**
- Sprint 4: Allocate 4 hours for test reorganization (PREP_PLAN Task 3)
- Create clear test categories
- Update CI to run different test suites
- Add test pyramid visualization

---

### 5. Mid-Sprint Checkpoints Not Formal ❌

**The Problem:**
- Day 7 mid-sprint checkpoint completed, but not formalized
- No structured template for checkpoints
- Checkpoint was ad-hoc, not systematic

**What Happened:**
- Day 7: Created MID_SPRINT_CHECKPOINT.md
- Verified 588 tests passing
- Checked integration health
- But no formal process or checklist

**What Should Happen:**
- Create checkpoint template BEFORE sprint
- Scheduled checkpoints: Days 3, 6, 8
- Required sections:
  - Tests passing (with trend)
  - Coverage metrics
  - Blockers/risks
  - Schedule status
  - Decision points

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Checkpoints are valuable but need structure**
- **Ad-hoc checkpoints easy to skip or do superficially**
- **Template ensures consistency and completeness**

---

### 6. Performance Not Tested ❌

**The Problem:**
- No performance benchmarks
- No scalability testing
- Only small test models (<10 variables)

**Missing Data:**
- How long does parsing take for 1000-variable model?
- How long does KKT assembly take?
- How large are generated MCP files?
- Memory usage for sparse Jacobians?

**Impact:**
- Unknown whether system scales
- May have performance issues with large models
- No baseline for future optimization

**Why It Happened:**
- Not in Sprint 3 scope
- Focus on correctness, not performance
- Small test models sufficient for validation

**What Should Happen:**
- Sprint 4: Add performance benchmarking
- Test with large models (100, 1000, 10000 variables)
- Profile code to find bottlenecks
- Establish performance baselines

---

### 7. PATH Solver Testing Deferred ❌

**The Problem:**
- No PATH solver available during sprint
- Generated MCP files compile but not solved
- Unknown whether MCP formulations actually solve correctly

**Missing Validation:**
- Do generated MCPs find correct solutions?
- Do solutions match original NLP solutions?
- How does PATH performance compare to NLP solvers?

**Impact:**
- Correctness uncertainty for solve phase
- No end-to-end validation of mathematical formulation
- May discover issues in Sprint 4 when solving attempted

**Why It Happened:**
- PATH solver not readily available
- Complexity of setting up GAMS+PATH
- Focus on code generation correctness

**What Should Happen:**
- Sprint 4: Set up GAMS+PATH environment
- Create solve validation tests
- Compare MCP solutions to NLP solutions
- Add PATH solver tests to CI (if possible)

---

### 8. Edge Case Testing Limited ❌

**The Problem:**
- Day 10 edge case testing abbreviated
- Only tested 5 golden examples thoroughly
- Many edge cases documented but not tested

**Edge Cases Not Tested:**
- Models with only equalities (no inequalities)
- Models with no bounds
- Models with all infinite bounds
- Models with potential duplicate bounds (only unit tested)
- Models with multi-dimensional parameters
- Extremely sparse Jacobians
- Very large models

**Why It Happened:**
- Time constraints on Day 10
- Prioritized golden examples over edge cases
- Edge cases documented for Sprint 4

**Impact:**
- May discover edge case bugs in production
- Unknown behavior for some model types

**What Should Happen:**
- Sprint 4: Systematic edge case testing
- Create edge case test matrix
- Add parameterized tests for edge cases
- Document expected behavior for all cases

---

### 9. Error Messages Could Be Better ❌

**The Problem:**
- Error messages functional but not optimal
- Some errors too technical for users
- Missing suggestions for common issues

**Examples:**
```python
# Current
"ValueError: Gradient must have index_mapping set"

# Better
"Internal error: Variable mapping not initialized. 
This is a bug in nlp2mcp. Please report at: 
https://github.com/user/nlp2mcp/issues"

# Current
"KeyError: 'x'"

# Better
"Variable 'x' not found in model. 
Available variables: y, z
Check spelling and variable declarations."
```

**Impact:**
- User confusion when errors occur
- More support questions
- Harder to debug user issues

**What Should Happen:**
- Sprint 4: Error message improvement pass
- Add contextual information to all errors
- Include suggestions for common mistakes
- Link to documentation for complex errors

---

### 10. Documentation Written During Sprint (Good But Late) ⚠️

**The Observation:**
- Documentation written during Days 9-10
- KKT_ASSEMBLY.md and GAMS_EMISSION.md created late
- Would have been helpful during Days 1-8

**Mixed Impact:**
- Good: Documentation accurate and reflects actual implementation
- Bad: Documentation not available to guide implementation
- Good: No documentation-code drift
- Bad: Had to hold design in memory during implementation

**What Could Be Better:**
- Write documentation BEFORE implementation (design docs)
- Update documentation DURING implementation (as changes occur)
- Final polish AFTER implementation (accuracy pass)

**Ideal Process:**
1. Week before sprint: Design docs with math and examples
2. During sprint: Update docs as implementation proceeds
3. Day 10: Final accuracy and completeness pass

---

- No "deferred" or "will do during sprint" items

**Expected Impact:** Better sprint execution, fewer process issues

---

### Priority 2: Technical Improvements

#### Action 2.1: Implement Test Reorganization (PREP_PLAN Task 3)
**Problem Addressed:** Flat test structure, slow test discovery  
**Owner:** Development team  
**Timeline:** Week before Sprint 4 (4 hours)

**Implementation:**
```
Old structure:
tests/
  unit/ad/test_gradient.py
  integration/ad/test_gradient.py
  e2e/test_integration.py
  validation/test_gams_check.py

New structure:
tests/
  unit/           # Fast, isolated, no I/O
    test_gradient.py
    test_jacobian.py
    ...
  integration/    # Component interaction
    test_ad_pipeline.py
    test_kkt_assembly.py
    ...
  e2e/            # Full pipeline
    test_nlp_to_mcp.py
    test_golden_files.py
    ...
  validation/     # External systems
    test_gams_syntax.py
    test_path_solve.py
    ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Run unit tests only: `pytest tests/unit` (fast feedback)
- Run integration+e2e: `pytest tests/integration tests/e2e`
- Clear test pyramid structure
- Better CI caching (unit tests rarely change)

**Success Criteria:**
- Tests reorganized into 4 clear categories
- CI updated to run suites separately
- Test documentation updated
- No tests lost in migration

---

#### Action 2.2: Add Performance Benchmarking
**Problem Addressed:** Unknown scalability, no performance baseline  
**Owner:** Development team  
**Timeline:** Sprint 4 Day 3-4 (1 day)

**Benchmark Suite:**
```python
# tests/benchmarks/test_performance.py

def test_parse_small_model():
    # 10 variables, 5 constraints
    assert parse_time < 0.1 seconds

def test_parse_medium_model():
    # 100 variables, 50 constraints
    assert parse_time < 1.0 seconds

def test_parse_large_model():
    # 1000 variables, 500 constraints
    assert parse_time < 10.0 seconds

def test_kkt_assembly_scalability():
    # Verify O(n²) or better complexity
    ...

def test_memory_usage():
    # Track memory for large models
    ...
```

**Deliverables:**

**Success Criteria:**
- Benchmarks for 3 model sizes (small, medium, large)
- Performance baselines in documentation
- Known scalability limits documented

---

#### Action 2.3: Set Up PATH Solver Validation
**Problem Addressed:** No solve-phase validation, mathematical correctness unknown  
**Owner:** Development team  
**Timeline:** Sprint 4 Day 1-2 (1 day setup)

**Implementation:**
1. Install PATH solver (if not already available)
2. Create solve validation test template:
```python
def test_solve_simple_nlp():
    # 1. Parse and convert to MCP
    mcp = convert("examples/simple_nlp.gms")
    
    # 2. Solve MCP with PATH
    mcp_solution = solve_with_path(mcp)
    
    # 3. Solve original NLP (for comparison)
    nlp_solution = solve_original("examples/simple_nlp.gms")
    
    # 4. Compare solutions
    assert solutions_match(mcp_solution, nlp_solution, tol=1e-6)
```

3. Add solve tests to CI (if PATH available)
4. Document expected solutions for golden files

**Success Criteria:**
- PATH solver installed and accessible
- 5 solve validation tests (one per golden file)
- Solutions match original NLP (tolerance 1e-6)
- Documented in TESTING.md

#### Action 2.4: Improve Error Messages
**Problem Addressed:** Technical error messages, poor user experience  
**Owner:** Development team  
**Timeline:** Sprint 4 Day 5-6 (1 day)

**Implementation:**
1. Audit all error messages in codebase
2. Categorize errors:
   - User errors (bad input, syntax errors)
   - Internal errors (bugs in nlp2mcp)
   - System errors (GAMS not found, etc.)
3. Improve each category:
   - User errors: Explain what's wrong + how to fix
   - Internal errors: Report bug URL + diagnostic info
   - System errors: Check installation + setup docs
4. Add error message tests

**Examples:**
```python
# Before
raise ValueError(f"Variable {var} not found")

# After
raise ValueError(
    f"Variable '{var}' not found in model.\n"
    f"Available variables: {', '.join(sorted(variables))}\n"
    f"Did you mean: {suggest_similar(var, variables)}?"
)

# Before
raise KeyError(eq)

# After
raise ValueError(
    f"Equation '{eq}' referenced but not defined.\n"
    f"Check equation definitions in your GAMS model.\n"
    f"All equations must be defined before use."
)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All exceptions include helpful context
- User errors suggest fixes
- Internal errors include bug report link
- Error message quality documented
