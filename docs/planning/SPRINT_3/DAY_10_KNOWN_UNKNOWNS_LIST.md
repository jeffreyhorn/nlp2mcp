- Test with actual GAMS compiler (if available)
- Generate test identifiers

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ Assumptions mostly CORRECT

- Underscore allowed ‚úì
- Some keywords reserved (Model, Set, Parameter, etc.)

**Implementation:**
- Added naming conventions in `src/kkt/naming.py`
- Prefixing scheme: `lam_`, `nu_`, `piL_`, `piU_`

**Impact:** Low - Prevented naming collisions

---

### Unknown 2.2: How to emit complementarity equations in GAMS MCP?

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved through research  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Day Resolved:** Day 5

**Initial Assumption:**
- Equations use `=G=` for inequalities
- Model declaration pairs equations and variables
- Syntax: `equation_name.variable_name`

**Verification Method:**
- Read PATH/GAMS MCP documentation
- Examine existing MCP examples
- Test generation

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ Assumption CORRECT
- MCP uses equation-variable pairing in Model statement
- No special equation syntax needed (just define normally)
- Pairing in Model: `eq_name.var_name`

**Implementation:**
- `src/emit/model.py` - Model MCP declaration
- Pairs stationarity equations with variables

**Impact:** None - Syntax was as expected

---

### Unknown 2.3: Can we use same identifier for equation and variable?

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Day Resolved:** Day 4

**Initial Assumption:**
- No, GAMS has separate namespaces
- Need distinct names

**Verification Method:**
- Test in GAMS with example model

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ Assumption CORRECT
- Equations and variables have separate namespaces
- Can have `x` (variable) and `x` (equation) - but confusing
- Chose to use distinct naming anyway (clarity)

**Impact:** Low - Used clear naming convention

---

### Unknown 2.4: How to handle INF bounds in GAMS?

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Day Resolved:** Day 6

**Initial Assumption:**
- Skip infinite bounds (don't emit œÄ multipliers for them)
- GAMS has implicit +INF/-INF for unbounded variables

**Verification Method:**
- Check KKT math: œÄ = 0 for inactive bounds
- Infinite bounds are always inactive
- No need to emit constraints

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ Assumption CORRECT
- Filter out infinite bounds before creating multipliers
- Implementation in `src/kkt/partition.py`
- Handles both scalar and indexed bounds

**Implementation:**
```python
# Only create piL if lower bound is finite
if bound_def.lower != NEG_INF:
    multipliers[f"piL_{var_name}"] = ...
```

**Impact:** None - Cleaner generated code

---

### Unknown 2.5: What's the syntax for equation indexing in GAMS?

**Status:** ‚ùå **INCORRECT ASSUMPTION - Major Issue (#47)**  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Day Discovered:** Day 8-9  
**Day Resolved:** Post-Sprint (Issue #47)

**Initial Assumption:**
- Indexed equations: `eq(i).. expr(i) =E= 0;` ‚úì (This was correct)
- Model declaration: `eq(i).var(i)` ‚ùå (This was WRONG)

**Actual Behavior:**
- Indexed equations declared: `eq(i).. ...` ‚úì
- But Model statement lists WITHOUT indices: `eq.var` (not `eq(i).var(i)`)
- Indexing is implicit from equation declaration

**Discovery Process:**
1. Generated `stat_x(i).x(i)` in Model
2. GAMS threw syntax errors
3. Realized indices are implicit
4. Fixed to `stat_x.x`

**Resolution:** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed in Issue #47
- Major refactoring of `src/kkt/stationarity.py`
- Changed from element-specific equations to indexed equations
- Updated `src/emit/model.py` to emit without indices

**Impact:** HIGH
- Required emergency fix (Issue #47)
- 2 days of additional work
- Complete refactoring of stationarity generation

**Lesson Learned:** 
- Should have tested GAMS MCP syntax with simple example first
- Assumed too much based on regular GAMS syntax
- **For Sprint 4:** Always validate code generation syntax early with compiler

**Priority:** High  
**Day Resolved:** Day 1-2

**Initial Assumption:**

**Design Decision:**
```python
# For variable x in constraint c:
# Add term: ‚àÇc/‚àÇx * Œª_c
term = Binary("*", deriv_expr, MultiplierRef(mult_name))
```

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ Design worked well
- Used existing AST nodes (Binary, Sum)
- Added `MultiplierRef` AST node type
- Clean symbolic representation

**Implementation:**
- `src/kkt/stationarity.py` - builds J^T Œª terms
- Uses Sum when domains differ
- Direct term when domains match

**Impact:** None - Clean design

---

### Unknown 3.2: Indexed bounds - How many multipliers needed?

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved (Post-Sprint refinement)

- `x(i)` with bounds needs `piL_x(i)` and `piU_x(i)`

**Discovery Process:**
1. Initial implementation treated bounds as scalar
2. Final review identified indexed bounds issue
3. Added lo_map, up_map, fx_map iteration

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 successfully implemented KKT synthesis and GAMS MCP code generation despite several unknowns and one major incorrect assumption (Issue #47). The retrospective analysis reveals:

### Success Metrics ‚úÖ

- **602 tests passing** - Comprehensive test coverage
- **5/5 golden files working** - All examples convert successfully
- **All critical unknowns resolved** - No blockers remaining
- **Clean integration** - Sprint 1/2 APIs worked as expected

### Key Learnings üìö

1. **Test syntax early** - Validate code generation with compiler immediately
2. **Document assumptions** - Make them explicit and testable
3. **Incremental validation** - Don't wait until end to test integration
4. **Known unknowns lists work** - This doc would have prevented Issue #47 if created earlier

### Looking Forward üöÄ

For Sprint 4, we will:
- Create known unknowns list BEFORE starting (not retrospectively)
- Set up GAMS/PATH validation environment
- Implement remaining PREP_PLAN tasks
- Focus on performance and edge cases
